  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly addresses the potential regulatory challenges, providing a clear and concise overview of the key issues such as safety, efficacy, resistance, and regulatory process considerations. in contrast, NEO emphasizes the lack of specific data and discusses related scientific aspects without explicitly focusing on the regulatory challenges, making it less effective in helping the reader understand and make informed judgments about the topic."

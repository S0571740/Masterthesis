DIVERSITY:How do I determine which patients would benefit from BoNT-A injections versus other treatments or therapies?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective by detailing various clinical factors, specific conditions, and evidence-based considerations involved in patient selection for bont-a therapy. it explores different treatment contexts, factors influencing decision-making, potential contraindications, and practical assessment tools, thereby offering a richer, more nuanced understanding. in contrast, NEO is more general and lacks the depth and diverse viewpoints present in MS."

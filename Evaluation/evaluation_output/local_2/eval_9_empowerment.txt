  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of effective advocacy strategies, emphasizing the importance of staying informed, building relationships, using evidence, and engaging clients. it also discusses specific activities and the importance of communication, supported by general knowledge and advocacy strategies. in contrast, MS is more superficial, mentioning broad concepts like grassroots organizing and coalition building but lacking depth, specific methods, or references to sources, which makes it less informative and potentially less actionable."

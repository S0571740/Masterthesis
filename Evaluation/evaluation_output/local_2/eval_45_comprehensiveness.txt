  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of how microwear analysis complements and validates starch and phytolith analyses, including the specific functions of microwear, how it confirms plant use, distinguishes tool functions, and fills interpretive gaps. in contrast, NEO offers only a brief statement without elaboration or specific examples, making it less thorough and complete in addressing the question."

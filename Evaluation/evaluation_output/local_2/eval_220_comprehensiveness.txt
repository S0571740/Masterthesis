  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it covers multiple specific applications of hydrological connectivity in habitat restoration, such as reconnecting fragmented habitats, managing floodplains and wetlands, and strategic project placement, supported by detailed examples and references. in contrast, MS provides a general overview without delving into specific methods or applications, lacking the depth and breadth of information present in NEO."

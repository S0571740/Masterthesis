  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a clear and concise summary of how policymakers can balance short-term needs with long-term goals, directly addressing the question with specific strategies involving immediate interventions and foundational initiatives. MS, while thorough and detailed, offers a more elaborative explanation with examples and context, making it less concise and slightly less direct in answering the core question."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of how climate change alters hydrological connectivity, including specific processes (e.g., droughts, storms, sedimentation) and potential ecological and socio-economic consequences. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without as much specificity or depth, making MS clearer and more directly aligned with the question."

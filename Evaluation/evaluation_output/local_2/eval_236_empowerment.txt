  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides specific strategies for supporting children's math communication, such as encouraging children to explain their thinking, creating math-rich environments through everyday activities, and modeling problem-solving processes. it offers concrete examples and reasoning behind each suggestion, fostering a clearer understanding for the reader. in contrast, MS is more general and lacks detailed explanation or supporting references, making it less informative and actionable."

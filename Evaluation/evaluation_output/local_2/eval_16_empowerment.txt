{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of effective strategies for community leaders to engage with policymakers. it emphasizes the importance of relationship-building, data and storytelling, coalition-building, public outreach, and ongoing dialogue, supported by references to relevant strategies and techniques. in contrast, NEO offers a more superficial overview without in-depth reasoning, specific approaches, or references, limiting its usefulness for informed judgment. MS's nuanced and evidence-based approach offers clearer guidance and a better understanding of effective engagement methods."

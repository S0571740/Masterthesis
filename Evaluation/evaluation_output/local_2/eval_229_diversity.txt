  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a broader range of perspectives and insights by detailing multiple types of interactive activities (discussions, debates, journaling, technology tools) and explaining their roles in promoting math communication. it incorporates different pedagogical approaches, emphasizes the importance of verbal reasoning, reflection, and technology, and references multiple angles, making it more multi-faceted and richer in content than NEO, which provides only a concise list of general activities without additional explanations or perspectives."

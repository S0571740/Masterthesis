  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS offers a more comprehensive and multi-faceted perspective by discussing both the positive economic implications (cost savings, biotech growth, job creation) and the challenges (high r&d costs, regulatory hurdles, resistance development). it also incorporates specific examples, such as targeting enzymes like ndm-1 and the use of technologies like pea and proteomics, adding depth and detail. additionally, MS references various types of sources and presents a balanced view of potential benefits and obstacles, making it richer and more diverse in perspectives. in contrast, NEO is more general, focusing on broad economic impacts without delving into specific angles or evidence."

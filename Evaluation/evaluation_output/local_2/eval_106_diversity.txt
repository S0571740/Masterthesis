  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive and multi-faceted overview of the guidelines for prescribing bont-a in children with spasticity. it covers multiple perspectives, including assessment criteria, dosing considerations, injection techniques, safety measures, and monitoring protocols. additionally, it contextualizes the treatment within clinical practice standards and emphasizes individualized care, repeated injections, and risk management, therefore providing a richer and more multi-dimensional view compared to MS, which only offers a brief, general statement on frequency and individualized treatment without additional insights or perspectives."

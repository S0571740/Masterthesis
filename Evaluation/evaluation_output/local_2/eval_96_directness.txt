  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive, specific, and clear explanation of the potential economic implications, including healthcare savings, industry benefits, r&d costs, and challenges. in contrast, MS offers a more general overview with less detail and specificity, making NEO a more precise and direct response to the question."

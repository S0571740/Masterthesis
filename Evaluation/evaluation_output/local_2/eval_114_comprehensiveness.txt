COMPREHENSIVENESS:Are there any specific exercises or stretches that should be avoided following BoNT-A administration?

{
"winner": 1,
"reasoning": "MS provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of post-bont-a exercise and stretch considerations, including specific activities to avoid (massaging, rubbing), general activity guidelines (avoid strenuous activities), and emphasizes following healthcare professional advice. it contextualizes the guidance with relevance to different treatment areas and mentions the lack of specific exercises to avoid according to the provided data. in contrast, NEO is brief, only mentions 'high-intensity' exercises and 'extreme or forceful movements' without elaboration, specific examples, or additional guidance, making it less comprehensive."

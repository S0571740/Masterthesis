{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed, specific, and clear overview of emerging therapies and technologies that could replace or complement bont-a in pediatric spasticity treatment. it directly addresses the question by listing particular novel options such as pharmacological agents, neuromodulation techniques, and regenerative medicine, whereas MS is overly brief and lacks specificity or detail. therefore, NEO better fulfills the requirement for a specific and clear response."

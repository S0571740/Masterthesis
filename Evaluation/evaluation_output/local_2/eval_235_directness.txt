  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses overcoming barriers and communicating complex math concepts by suggesting practical, specific strategies like breaking down concepts, establishing clear relationships, using visual aids, and real-world examples. in contrast, MS provides a broad overview of strategies but is less concise and more general, including extensive details that, while informative, are less directly focused and less concise in answering the core question."

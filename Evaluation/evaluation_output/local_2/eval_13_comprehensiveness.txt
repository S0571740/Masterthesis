  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it details multiple aspects of how teachers can address social determinants of health, including creating supportive environments, recognizing signs of social disadvantage, integrating social-emotional learning, advocating for community resources, and promoting health literacy. it incorporates specific strategies, highlights the importance of partnerships and referrals, and discusses the broader role of teachers beyond the classroom. in contrast, MS is shorter and covers fewer specific actions, making it less detailed and less thorough overall."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly explains the relationship between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity, detailing how connectivity influences species movement, habitat access, and ecosystem health. it provides a clear, specific explanation of the mechanisms and consequences, whereas NEO offers a vague statement without elaboration or specific details."

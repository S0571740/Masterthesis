  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how policymakers can balance short-term needs with long-term goals. it covers strategic prioritization, stakeholder engagement, evidence-based decision making, flexibility, adaptive policies, and the importance of balancing immediate relief with structural reforms. in contrast, MS offers a more general overview without specific strategies or mechanisms, lacking the depth and breadth necessary for a thorough understanding of the complexities involved."

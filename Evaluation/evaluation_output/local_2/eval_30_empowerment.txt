{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed explanation of why integrating microbotanical and microwear data with technological and contextual information is important. it clearly describes how these methods contribute specific insights (e.g., identifying plant taxa, tool usage patterns) and emphasizes the added value of combining functional evidence with broader archaeological context. furthermore, it offers concrete examples such as research at çatalhöyük and references specific data points, strengthening its informativeness and credibility. in contrast, MS is more general, summarizing the importance without delving into how the integration yields specific insights or providing supporting details or examples."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view by discussing injection techniques (emg, ultrasound, manual palpation), specific dosing strategies (individualized, dose ranges, titration), considerations on frequency and repetition, and safety monitoring. it incorporates multiple perspectives, technical details, and practical considerations, making it more diverse and rich than NEO, which is more general and less detailed."

DIRECTNESS:Q: How do the findings from this study relate to broader trends in human dietary practices during the Neolithic period?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly and comprehensively explains how the study's findings relate to broader neolithic trends, explicitly mentioning dietary practices, plant domestication, resource management, and trade networks. in contrast, NEO is vague and generic, lacking specific details or clear links to broader trends."

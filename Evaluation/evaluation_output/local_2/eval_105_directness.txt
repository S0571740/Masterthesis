  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS directly and comprehensively addresses the question by detailing the long-term implications of repeated bont-a injections on a child's muscle development and function. it discusses specific effects such as muscle atrophy, morphological changes, and impacts on growth and development, providing relevant context and nuance. in contrast, NEO offers only a vague statement that such long-term implications may exist without elaboration, making it less clear and specific."

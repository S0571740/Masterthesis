COMPREHENSIVENESS:How can I ensure optimal outcomes and minimize recurrence of muscle spasticity after surgical intervention?

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of multiple aspects crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes and minimizing recurrence of muscle spasticity after surgery. it covers preoperative assessment, specific surgical techniques, postoperative management, long-term follow-up, and additional modalities, offering a thorough understanding of the multifaceted approach. in contrast, NEO offers only general recommendations focused on rehabilitation, medication, and follow-up, lacking detailed discussion of surgical procedures, intraoperative considerations, and other important strategies. therefore, MS better addresses all aspects of the question in a complete manner."

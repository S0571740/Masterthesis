  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed explanation of the limitations of the available data, emphasizes relevant fields of study, and offers specific suggestions for reputable institutions and sources where the reader can find courses or workshops. it also contextualizes the topic within research communities and suggests avenues for finding tailored options. in contrast, MS offers a very brief and general suggestive statement without explanation, reasoning, or specific sources, making it less helpful for informed decision-making."

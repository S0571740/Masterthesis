{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of how hydrological connectivity can inform adaptation strategies. it covers multiple specific applications such as flood risk management, water resource sustainability, and community-based initiatives, including examples and references to data and practices. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without the same depth or variety of specific applications, thereby lacking the thoroughness seen in MS."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and nuanced explanation of how partnerships can support math communication development. it clearly describes specific roles and contributions of each sector, provides concrete examples such as internships and policy support, and emphasizes the importance of collaboration. additionally, it includes references to data sources, which enhance credibility and help the reader make informed judgments. in contrast, NEO is brief and lacks detailed reasoning, concrete examples, or source references, making it less informative and less helpful for understanding the topic thoroughly."

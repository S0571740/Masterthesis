{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective by discussing multiple strategies such as encouraging children to explain their thinking, creating math-rich environments through everyday activities, posing open-ended questions, and modeling problem-solving behaviors. it incorporates various angles—cognitive development, language, real-world contexts, and parental modeling—providing a richer, more nuanced account of how parents can support math communication. in contrast, NEO provides a more general overview with limited specific approaches, making it less varied and detailed compared to MS."

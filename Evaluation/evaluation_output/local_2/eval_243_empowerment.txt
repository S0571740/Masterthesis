EMPOWERMENT:How can researchers apply the findings from this study to inform future investigations into math communication development?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a relevant and general explanation of how researchers can apply the study's findings to future investigations, emphasizing the importance of incorporating patterns and insights into methodology. it offers concrete guidance aligned with the question. conversely, NEO indicates a lack of information about the specific study and asks for additional details, which does not directly help the reader understand how to apply findings or foster informed judgments. therefore, MS more effectively supports understanding without misleading or assuming details not provided."

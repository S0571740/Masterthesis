  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed, specific explanation of how starch and phytolith analyses contribute to understanding plant processing activities, including the types of information they reveal and examples of their application. in contrast, MS is more general and less detailed, offering a broad overview without illustrating the specific ways these analyses clarify plant processing behaviors."

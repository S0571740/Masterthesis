COMPREHENSIVENESS:In what ways can hydrological connectivity be used to design more effective wetland restoration projects?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive coverage of how hydrological connectivity can be used in wetland restoration, including specific aspects such as natural flow pathways, sediment and nutrient transport, species migration, and climate resilience. it references specific interventions, the importance of understanding spatial and temporal variability, and includes multiple data sources to support these points. in contrast, MS offers a general overview without incorporating specific mechanisms, practical strategies, or detailed considerations to comprehensively address how hydrological connectivity informs wetland restoration design."

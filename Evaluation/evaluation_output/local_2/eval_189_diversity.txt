  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a multi-faceted and comprehensive set of perspectives on how policymakers can incorporate findings into decision-making. it discusses evidence-based development, transparency, stakeholder engagement, ongoing evaluation, and capacity buildingâ€”covering various dimensions of policy integration. in contrast, NEO provides a more general and less detailed suggestion focused mainly on evaluation and transparency, without exploring multiple angles or supporting evidence, making it less diverse and rich in perspectives."

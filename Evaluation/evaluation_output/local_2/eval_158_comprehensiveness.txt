COMPREHENSIVENESS:How does Olink Explore enable high-throughput analysis of nearly 1500 proteins in multiplex?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed explanation of the technological mechanisms behind olink explore's high-throughput capability, including the specific use of proximity extension assay (pea) technology, integration with next-generation sequencing (ngs), and sample handling strategies. it thoroughly describes how these components work together to analyze nearly 1500 proteins in multiplex. in contrast, MS offers only a broad overview without specific details, making NEO substantially more comprehensive and complete regarding the question."

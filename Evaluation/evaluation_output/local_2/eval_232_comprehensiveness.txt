  "reasoning": "MS is more comprehensive because it provides specific examples of visual representations (graphs, diagrams, geometric figures) and explains their purpose in clarifying concepts. it also discusses how visual tools assist in problem-solving, communication, and engagement, supported by references to educational research. in contrast, NEO is more general and less detailed, mentioning only that visual aids help organize and understand information without elaborating on types, applications, or benefits in different contexts."

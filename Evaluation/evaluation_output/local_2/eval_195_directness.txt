DIRECTNESS:How can students apply the concepts learned from this study to real-world problems in genomics and personalized medicine?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses how students can apply concepts from the study to real-world problems by focusing on analyzing genetic data, identifying patterns, and making treatment decisions. in contrast, MS is overly elaborate and provides somewhat general strategies rather than a clear, concise explanation directly related to applying the concepts from the study. while MS covers multiple areas, it lacks the straightforward, specific focus on practical application as requested in the question."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted discussion with detailed explanations of various physical therapy strategies—such as stretching, positioning, strengthening, functional training, and patient education—and how these can be tailored post-bont-a. it also references multiple approaches and evidence sources, providing a multi-dimensional perspective. in contrast, MS is very brief and lacks depth, specific insights, or multiple viewpoints, making it less rich and diverse in its coverage."

EMPOWERMENT:Can Olink Explore help identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed explanation of how olink explore's technological features, such as high-throughput proteomics, proximity extension assays, and integration with next-generation sequencing, enable the identification of novel biomarkers. it also offers specific examples of its application in real-world studies, supporting its claims with data references. in contrast, NEO offers only a superficial statement with no supporting details, reasoning, or evidence, making it less informative for understanding how olink explore aids in biomarker discovery."

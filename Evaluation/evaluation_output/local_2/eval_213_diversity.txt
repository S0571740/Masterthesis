  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional view by including various strategies such as management practices, infrastructure adjustments, and ecological restoration. it discusses policy measures, structural modifications, and ecosystem-based approaches, offering multiple perspectives and practical solutions. additionally, it emphasizes ecological resilience and infrastructure engineering, broadening the scope beyond the predominantly conservation-focused strategies in MS. although MS mentions key mitigation techniques, NEO's inclusion of structural interventions, policy considerations, and ecological restoration demonstrates a more varied and insightful approach to the question."

  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the benefits of developing strong math communication skills, including their impact on understanding, collaboration, academic performance, and future pursuits. it also references the importance of these skills in assessments and advanced coursework, offering a broader context. additionally, it cites generalized knowledge and educational resources, adding credibility. in contrast, MS offers a concise overview but lacks the depth, supporting reasoning, and recognition of broader implications that NEO provides, making it less informative overall."

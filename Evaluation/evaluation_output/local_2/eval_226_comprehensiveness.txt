  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it covers a wider range of strategies for improving mathematical language skills, including vocabulary development, conceptual understanding, discourse, visual aids, and writing activities. it provides specific techniques, emphasizes the importance of context and communication, and references research and pedagogical methods, making it more comprehensive. in contrast, NEO focuses primarily on vocabulary and explanation activities, lacking the broader scope and depth of strategies discussed in MS."

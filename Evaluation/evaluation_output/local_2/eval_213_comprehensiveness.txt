  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed overview of strategies, including management practices, infrastructure modifications, and ecological restoration efforts. it discusses specific methods such as restoring natural pathways, constructing controlled flow structures, and removing barriers, which are not covered in NEO. additionally, MS emphasizes ecosystem resilience, water policy measures, and buffer strategies like reservoirs and aquifer recharge, offering a broader and more thorough scope of mitigation strategies without redundancy. in contrast, NEO mentions several relevant strategies but is less detailed and misses some interconnected approaches present in MS."

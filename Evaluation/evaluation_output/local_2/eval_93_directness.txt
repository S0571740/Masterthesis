{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it explicitly discusses how understanding the structural differences can inform inhibitor design, therapeutic development, and diagnostic tools, providing a detailed and specific explanation of potential applications. in contrast, NEO is vague and lacks detail, simply mentioning general benefits like developing new antibiotics and treatments without elaboration."

  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it details a variety of assessment methods, including oral presentations, written explanations, group discussions, self and peer assessments, and portfolios. it emphasizes the importance of multiple evidence sources, clear criteria, and standardized rubrics, providing a thorough approach to evaluating math communication skills. in contrast, MS offers general strategies but lacks the depth of specific assessment tools and broader approaches highlighted in NEO, making it less detailed and comprehensive."

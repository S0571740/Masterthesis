COMPREHENSIVENESS:Q: How does the presence of palm phytoliths indicate long-distance exchange networks?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is more comprehensive as it provides detailed context about specific palm species, their geographical associations, and how their phytoliths indicate long-distance exchange networks. it discusses particular archaeological sites, the significance of exotic versus native species, and links the presence of palm phytoliths to broader socio-economic interactions, supported by references to other traded materials. in contrast, NEO offers a general explanation without specific examples, species identification, archaeological context, or discussion of regional trade implications, making it less detailed and thorough."

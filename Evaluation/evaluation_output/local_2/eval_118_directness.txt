{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a concise, directly relevant list of potential risks and complications specifically associated with combining surgery and bont-a therapy in pediatric patients. in contrast, NEO, while more comprehensive and detailed, offers broader context and discusses additional considerations, making it less focused on clearly enumerating the specific risks and complications from the question. therefore, MS is better at directly addressing the question."

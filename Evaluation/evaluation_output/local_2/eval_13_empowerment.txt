  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and nuanced explanation of the teacher's role in addressing social determinants of health. it discusses multiple aspects such as identifying signs of stress, incorporating social-emotional learning, advocating for community resources, and enhancing health literacy, supported by references to data sources. this detailed approach helps the reader understand the various ways teachers can influence health outcomes and makes the rationale behind these roles clearer. in contrast, NEO is brief and lacks elaboration, reasoning, or sourcing, making it less informative and less effective in guiding informed judgments about the topic."

COMPREHENSIVENESS:Are there any alternative treatments or therapies that could be used in conjunction with BoNT-A to minimize side effects?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of possible strategies and techniques (such as adjunct therapies, cooling methods, precise injection techniques, and imaging guidance) that could be used alongside bont-a to minimize side effects. in contrast, MS is vague and offers only a yes/no response without elaboration or specific details addressing different approaches or methods, making it less thorough and complete."

DIRECTNESS:Are there any software tools available for simulating and modeling particle behavior in microfluidic systems?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly addresses the question by mentioning that software tools such as comsol multiphysics and ansys fluent are used for simulating and modeling particle behavior in microfluidic systems, even though they are not specified in the provided data. it clearly and specifically provides examples of relevant software, fulfilling the requirement for a direct and concise answer. in contrast, NEO merely confirms the existence of such tools without providing any specific examples or details, making it less comprehensive and specific."

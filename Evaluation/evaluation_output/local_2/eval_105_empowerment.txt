{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a comprehensive, nuanced explanation of the long-term implications of repeated bont-a injections on a child's muscle development and function. it discusses both potential risks and benefits, references mechanisms of action, and cites multiple data sources and studies to support its claims. in contrast, NEO offers only a vague statement without any explanation, reasoning, or supporting evidence, making it less informative and less helpful for understanding and making informed judgments about the topic."

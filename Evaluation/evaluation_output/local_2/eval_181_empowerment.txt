  "reasoning": "NEO provides a comprehensive and nuanced explanation of how healthcare professionals can utilize genetic research insights to improve patient outcomes. it discusses understanding evolving research trends, applying genetic knowledge to personalized medicine, and interpreting genetic testing results, all supported by references to data and relationships. in contrast, MS offers a general suggestion to incorporate findings into clinical practice without detailing how or providing supporting evidence, making it less informative and less grounded in specific reasoning or sources. therefore, NEO better helps the reader understand the topic and make informed judgments."

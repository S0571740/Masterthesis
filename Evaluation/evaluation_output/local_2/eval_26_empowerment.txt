EMPOWERMENT:Q: How does the presence of palm phytoliths indicate long-distance exchange networks?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a comprehensive explanation by specifying the types of palm phytoliths, their geographic associations, and how their presence indicates long-distance exchange. it discusses specific archaeological sites, contextualizes findings with regional trade, and connects phytolith presence to broader exchange networks, thereby offering clearer reasoning and more detailed sources. conversely, NEO offers a more general and less detailed explanation, lacking specific examples, contextual information, or discussion of how phytoliths are linked to trade networks, making it less effective in helping the reader fully understand and evaluate the topic."

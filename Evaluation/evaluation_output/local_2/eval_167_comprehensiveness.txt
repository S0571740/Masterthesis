{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it details multiple aspects of how olink explore integrates with existing research frameworks and pipelines. it discusses the technology (ngs readout, pea), compatibility with sequencing instruments, support for multi-omics studies, data quality controls, automation capabilities, and scalability within laboratory workflows. in contrast, MS offers only a general statement about seamless integration without elaborating on specific tools, technologies, or workflows, making it less thorough overall."

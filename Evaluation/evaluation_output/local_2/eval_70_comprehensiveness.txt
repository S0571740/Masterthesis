  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of multiple revenue streams and business models, including product sales, licensing, service and subscription models, reagent sales, contract services, data monetization, partnerships, and regulatory services. it includes specific examples and elaborates on each aspect, covering both direct income sources and strategic collaborations. in contrast, NEO offers a more limited overview, mentioning sales, licensing, subscriptions, and partnerships without the depth or specific examples provided in MS. therefore, MS offers a more thorough and complete coverage of the potential revenue streams and business models for companies developing direct naat products."

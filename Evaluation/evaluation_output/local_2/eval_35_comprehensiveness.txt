COMPREHENSIVENESS:Q: Can you discuss the significance of palm phytoliths as a rare find in this context?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a thorough and detailed discussion of the significance of palm phytoliths, including their rarity, implications for long-distance trade and exchange networks, specific types of palms involved, potential functions in material culture, and their broader archaeological and cultural importance at çatalhöyük. MS offers a more general statement about their rarity and potential significance but lacks the depth and specific details present in NEO, making it less comprehensive."

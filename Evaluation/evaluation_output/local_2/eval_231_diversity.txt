  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to improving mathematical language skills, including active participation, vocabulary practice, reading strategies, writing exercises, visual aids, and feedback, thus offering multiple perspectives and detailed strategies. in contrast, NEO offers a more limited set of methods focused mainly on discussion, vocabulary, clarification, and problem-solving, without the depth or variety seen in MS."

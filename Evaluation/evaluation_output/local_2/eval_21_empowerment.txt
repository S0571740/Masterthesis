{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive overview of various research methods and designs, including specific examples such as spatial analysis, geospatial mapping, ethnographic studies, and longitudinal approaches. it also discusses their application in addressing concentrated disadvantage, emphasizes the importance of integrating quantitative and qualitative methods, and references multiple sources and examples that lend credibility and context. in contrast, MS is more limited, mentioning only qualitative methods and general study designs without detailed explanation or specific examples, making it less informative for understanding the full scope of successful research strategies."

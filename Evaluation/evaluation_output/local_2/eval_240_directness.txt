  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly lists specific types of resources and support options (websites, local programs, teachers, community organizations) with explanations of how they can help improve math communication skills, providing a clear and detailed response. in contrast, MS is more general and less specific, mentioning categories of support without elaborating on how they effectively assist in improving math communication."

  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive as it covers a broader range of benefits of math communication skills, including understanding, retention, collaboration, assessment performance, and future academic pursuits. it also emphasizes the importance of these skills for lifelong learning and critical thinking. in contrast, MS focuses primarily on understanding, collaboration, and performance without addressing the long-term or broader impacts. therefore, NEO provides a more thorough and complete coverage of the question."

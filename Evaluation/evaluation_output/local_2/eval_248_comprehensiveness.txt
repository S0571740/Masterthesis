{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive discussion of the various ways educational institutions, industry partners, and government agencies can collaborate, including specific methods, examples, and roles. it covers curriculum development, practical applications, policy support, and scalability, offering a thorough exploration of the potential partnerships relevant to math communication development. in contrast, MS is brief and lacks specific examples or elaboration on roles and strategies, making it less detailed."

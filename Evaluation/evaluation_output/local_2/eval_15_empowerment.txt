  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of multiple strategies, including the rationale behind each approach and references to well-established educational concepts such as social-emotional learning and culturally responsive teaching. it explicitly highlights the importance of building relationships and creating a safe environment, supporting its claims with underlying reasoning and general knowledge, which helps the reader understand the practical implementation and effectiveness of these strategies. in contrast, NEO is concise and mentions several strategies but lacks depth, reasoning, and explicit sources to justify the effectiveness of these approaches."

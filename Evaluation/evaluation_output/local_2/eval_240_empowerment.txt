{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive overview of various resources and support options, including online platforms, school-based programs, community events, and online forums, with clear explanations of how these can aid in improving math communication skills. it emphasizes accessibility and practical strategies, and references general expert recommendations without making unsupported claims. in contrast, MS is more superficial, offering a brief list of potential actions without elaboration or reasoning about how these support methods are effective, and lacks specific detail or context to guide informed judgment."

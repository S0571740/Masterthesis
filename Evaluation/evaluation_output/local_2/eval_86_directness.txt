DIRECTNESS:How will this research impact my treatment options for NDM-1-positive infections?

{
"winner": 2,
"reasoning": "NEO directly addresses the impact of the research on treatment options by explicitly stating it could influence future treatments and develop new therapeutic agents targeting ndm-1. in contrast, MS is vague, merely suggesting that research 'may lead to advancements' without specifying how or in what ways it affects treatment options. therefore, NEO provides a clearer and more specific response to the question."

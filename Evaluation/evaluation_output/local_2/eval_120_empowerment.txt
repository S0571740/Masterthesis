  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed explanation of specific emerging technologies, such as neurostimulation methods, minimally invasive procedures, robotic-assisted surgeries, and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. it also discusses how these technologies enhance surgical precision, safety, and outcomes, supported by references. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without specific details or sources, making it less informative and less helpful for making informed judgments about the topic."

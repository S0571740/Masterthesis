  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, multi-faceted perspective by identifying diverse strategies such as targeted collaborations, focusing on specific gene domains, utilizing bibliometric tools, and engaging with research institutions and funding bodies. it introduces multiple angles—publication patterns, gene focus, technology adoption, and stakeholder partnerships—supported by concrete data references, thereby offering a richer and more varied set of insights. in contrast, NEO is very brief and lacks any detailed perspectives or evidence, providing only a generic statement without exploring different facets or offering specific strategies."

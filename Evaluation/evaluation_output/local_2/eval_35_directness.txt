DIRECTNESS:Q: Can you discuss the significance of palm phytoliths as a rare find in this context?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly explains the significance of palm phytoliths by emphasizing their rarity and its implications for long-distance exchange networks and cultural interactions at çatalhöyük. it provides specific details about their potential origin, uses, and how their presence indicates complex social connections. conversely, MS is more general, mentioning rarity and potential insights into the environment and human activities without elaborating on the significance or specific implications, making it less clear and specific."

  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed exploration of multiple strategies, including creating a safe and inclusive environment, building trusting relationships, incorporating social-emotional learning, promoting a growth mindset, and recognizing student successes. it also includes specific practices such as culturally responsive teaching, mentoring, and sel, backed by references to educational research. in contrast, MS offers a succinct list of strategies without elaborating on how to implement them or their importance, making NEO more thorough and complete."

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted exploration of the social and cultural contexts of food processing at çatalhöyük. it discusses various perspectives, including technological aspects (tools and processing techniques), ethnobotanical knowledge (plant uses, detoxification, medicinal purposes), social interactions (resource exchange, trade), spatial organization within structures, and the integration of food processing with ritual and craft activities. it cites multiple types of evidence such as tools, plant remains, spatial arrangements, and long-distance exchange, providing a richly detailed and multi-dimensional view. in contrast, MS is brief and generic, mentioning only general insights into dietary habits, cooking techniques, and food practices without delving into different perspectives or types of evidence, resulting in less diversity and depth."

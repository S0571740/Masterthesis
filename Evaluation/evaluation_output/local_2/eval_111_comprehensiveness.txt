  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed, comprehensive overview of multiple aspects involved in integrating bont-a injections into treatment plans, including patient assessment, combination with other therapies, timing, dosing, monitoring, and potential additional interventions. it offers specific guidance and considerations that encompass clinical evaluation, therapeutic integration, and follow-up, making it thorough and complete. in contrast, MS gives a high-level overview with minimal specifics, lacking detailed discussion of treatment protocols, assessment methods, dosing strategies, monitoring, and combination therapies, which makes it less comprehensive."

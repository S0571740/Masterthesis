EMPOWERMENT:Are there any international standards or guidelines for ensuring the quality and safety of direct NAATs?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed explanation of relevant international and regulatory frameworks, including the who's guidelines and fda oversight, along with references to specific principles and systems. it clarifies that there are no explicit international standards solely dedicated to direct naats but highlights pertinent standards that influence their quality and safety. by contrast, MS offers a very brief and vague affirmation without elaboration, sources, or nuanced understanding. therefore, NEO better helps the reader understand the context and make informed judgments about existing standards and guidelines."

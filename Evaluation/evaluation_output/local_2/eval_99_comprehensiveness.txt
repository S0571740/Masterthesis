  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive overview of the regulatory challenges by mentioning key aspects such as safety, efficacy, manufacturing, approval pathways, and the specific considerations related to metal-based inhibitors targeting bi(iii)-bound ndm-1. it also contextualizes the lack of direct data in the provided sources, offering a broader understanding of potential regulatory hurdles. in contrast, MS offers only a brief, general summary without addressing the specific challenges associated with the unique nature of the target or illustrating the regulatory process in detail."

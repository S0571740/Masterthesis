  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a more detailed and comprehensive overview of emerging technologies and techniques for improving surgery in muscle spasticity. it discusses specific neurostimulation methods, advances in surgical techniques like minimally invasive and robotic-assisted procedures, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, and improved imaging and surgical planning tools, covering multiple aspects in depth. in contrast, NEO mentions broad categories without elaboration on specific techniques or technologies, making it less thorough overall."

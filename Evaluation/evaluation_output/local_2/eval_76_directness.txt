DIRECTNESS:What are the implications of using Bi(III) instead of zinc in NDM-1 binding?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO directly addresses the implications by explaining how bi(iii) differs from zinc and its specific effects on ndm-1's structure, activity, and potential as an inhibitor, thus providing a clear and detailed explanation. in contrast, MS is more general and less specific, mentioning potential changes but lacking detailed mechanisms or outcomes related to the substitution."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly and specifically explains how research findings on ndm-1 properties can inform development of new treatment strategies, such as designing inhibitors based on enzyme structure, metal interactions, and stability studies. in contrast, MS is vague and general, mentioning insights into characteristics and vulnerabilities without detailing how these specifically translate into treatment strategies."

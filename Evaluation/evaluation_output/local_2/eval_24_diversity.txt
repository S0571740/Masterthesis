  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional exploration of strategies to balance generalizability with specific context considerations. it discusses multiple approaches such as mixed-methods, adaptable frameworks, detailed contextual documentation, and ongoing theory-practice dialogue, each explained with examples and supporting insights. in contrast, MS provides a more limited perspective, mainly focusing on mixed methods and stakeholder collaboration without delving into additional strategies or nuanced insights, making it less varied and rich overall."

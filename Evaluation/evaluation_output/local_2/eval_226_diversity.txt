  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive and multi-dimensional, providing multiple strategies such as explicit vocabulary teaching, promoting discourse through discussion and collaboration, using visual supports, and integrating writing activities. it references research and evidence to support these strategies, offering a broader range of perspectives and approaches. in contrast, MS is limited primarily to vocabulary-building activities, explanation practices, collaborative learning, and real-world problem engagement, and lacks mention of visual aids, writing, or research references. therefore, NEO is richer and more varied in its insights."

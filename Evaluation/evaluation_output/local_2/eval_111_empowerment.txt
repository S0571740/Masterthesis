  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, detailed, and structured explanation of how to incorporate bont-a injections into treatment planning. it covers critical aspects such as assessment, integration with other therapies, timing, dosing, monitoring, and potential additional interventions, thus helping the reader make informed judgments. additionally, it discusses the rationale behind combining treatments and emphasizes individualized care, which adds depth and clarity. in contrast, NEO offers a more superficial overview without elaborating on the steps, evidence, or specific considerations, making it less informative and less helpful for understanding the full scope of treatment planning with bont-a."

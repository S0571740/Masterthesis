{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed and well-supported explanation of how the findings suggest a seasonal calendar for gathering wild plant resources, including specific evidence such as microbotanical analyses, ecological zones, plant phenology, and ethnobotanical knowledge. conversely, MS offers only a vague and general statement about the importance of a seasonal calendar without providing concrete reasoning, examples, or sources. therefore, NEO better helps the reader understand the topic comprehensively and accurately."

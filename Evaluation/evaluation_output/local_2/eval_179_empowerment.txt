EMPOWERMENT:How does the analysis of author institutional affiliations impact the identification of early-stage research institutions?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed explanation of how analyzing author affiliations impacts the identification of early-stage research institutions, including specific ways it can map research landscapes, reveal organizational involvement, and inform strategic decisions. it also references the importance of data and bibliometric approaches, offering a comprehensive understanding. in contrast, NEO offers a brief, superficial statement without elaboration, reasoning, or supporting details, making it less effective in helping the reader fully understand the topic."

DIVERSITY:Q: How do the results of this study support or challenge previous interpretations about the site's farming economy?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS offers a richly detailed, multi-faceted perspective that integrates archaeological evidence, trade networks, resource exploitation, and subsistence strategies, supported by multiple specific data sources and evidentiary references. in contrast, NEO is vague and generic, lacking depth, specific examples, or acknowledgment of different viewpoints. therefore, MS provides a more diverse and comprehensive synthesis of perspectives on the site's farming economy."

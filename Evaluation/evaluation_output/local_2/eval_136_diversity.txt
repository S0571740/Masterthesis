  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective on regulatory hurdles for lab-on-a-chip devices in clinical settings. it discusses specific regulatory agencies like the fda, highlights milestones such as clia-waived status, and delves into challenges related to validation, safety, manufacturing standards, and post-market requirements. the answer also references multiple sources and concrete examples, offering a nuanced and multi-faceted view. in contrast, NEO offers only a brief acknowledgment of potential hurdles without exploring specific aspects, sources, or detailed insights, making it less varied and rich in perspective."

  "reasoning": "NEO provides a comprehensive and detailed set of practical tips on engaging with math problems through multiple solutions and representations. it clearly explains each strategy with examples and references to educational concepts, enhancing the reader's understanding and ability to make informed judgements. in contrast, MS offers a more general overview without specific methods, reasoning, or sources, making it less informative and actionable. therefore, NEO better promotes understanding and critical thinking about the topic."

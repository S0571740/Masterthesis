COMPREHENSIVENESS:Q: How do the findings from this study relate to broader trends in human dietary practices during the Neolithic period?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it thoroughly discusses various aspects of neolithic dietary practices derived from the study, including plant use, domestication, resource management, ethnobotanical knowledge, and regional exchange networks. in contrast, MS offers only a general overview with minimal details, lacking specific information about the types of plants, practices, or broader trends identified in the study."

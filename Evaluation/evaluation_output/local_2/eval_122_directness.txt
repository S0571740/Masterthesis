DIRECTNESS:Are there any potential biomarkers or genetic markers that could predict response to BoNT-A therapy in children with muscle spasticity?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed, specific, and clear explanation that directly addresses the current state of knowledge about biomarkers and genetic markers for predicting response to bont-a therapy in children with spasticity. it explains that no definitive markers are available yet and discusses ongoing research, whereas NEO is overly vague and does not offer any specific information or clarification beyond confirming that such potential markers may exist. therefore, MS is more specific and effectively addresses the question."

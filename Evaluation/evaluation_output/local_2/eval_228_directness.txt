{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses the role of visual representations in facilitating math communication by providing specific functions such as making concepts concrete, supporting different learning styles, and enabling clear articulation of reasoning. it also elaborates on how visual tools serve as common reference points and improve understanding. in contrast, MS is more general and less detailed, mentioning benefits like making concepts accessible and encouraging discussion but lacking the depth and specificity found in NEO."

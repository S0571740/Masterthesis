  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a clear and concise explanation of how researchers can balance the need for generalizability with context-specific findings, specifically mentioning mixed methods and collaboration with stakeholders as key strategies. in contrast, NEO is more elaborate and includes additional strategies and detailed justifications, but it lacks the brevity and direct focus needed for a concise answer to the specific question."

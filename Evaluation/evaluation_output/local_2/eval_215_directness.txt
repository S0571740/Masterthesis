  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed, specific explanation of how hydrological connectivity can be used to optimize water allocation and minimize conflicts, including concrete applications such as water sharing agreements, infrastructure design, and stakeholder engagement. in contrast, MS is more general and lacks specific examples or detailed mechanisms, making it less clear and concise in directly addressing the ways hydrological connectivity can be utilized."

COMPREHENSIVENESS:How does Olink Explore enable a better understanding of the proteome in healthy as well as disease cohorts?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of how olink explore enables understanding of the proteome, including the technology used, the range of proteins analyzed, its applications in health and disease research, and features like sensitivity, specificity, and data quality. in contrast, MS offers a very general overview without specific details on the platform's capabilities, technologies, or the breadth of proteomic analysis, making it less thorough and complete."

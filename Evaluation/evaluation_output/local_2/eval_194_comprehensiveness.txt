  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed, multi-faceted explanation of how the study's findings can impact educational initiatives. it covers specific ways to incorporate research trends, process understanding, research focus areas, and publication influence into educational content, offering concrete examples and insights. in contrast, NEO is more general and less detailed, mentioning potential influence without elaborating on specific mechanisms or aspects, making it less comprehensive."

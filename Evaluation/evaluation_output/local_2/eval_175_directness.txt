  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed discussion of the specific risks and challenges associated with adopting olink explore technology, including technical integration, data interpretation, costs, and regulatory issues. in contrast, NEO is vague, mentioning general issues like data security, training, and compatibility without directly addressing the specific risks and challenges related to the technology itself, making it less clear and less focused on the question."

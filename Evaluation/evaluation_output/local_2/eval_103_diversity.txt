DIVERSITY:Are there any alternative treatments or therapies that could be used in conjunction with BoNT-A to minimize side effects?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it presents a multi-faceted and detailed overview of potential strategies to minimize side effects of bont-a, including adjunct therapies, technical techniques, and individualized treatment adjustments, supported by clinical experience and guidelines. in contrast, NEO provides only a simple affirmation that alternatives exist without elaborating on different types, perspectives, or supporting evidence, making it less comprehensive and diverse."

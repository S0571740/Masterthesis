COMPREHENSIVENESS:Q: Can you discuss the significance of starch and phytolith analyses for understanding plant processing activities?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a much more detailed and comprehensive explanation of the significance of starch and phytolith analyses. it covers their preservation mechanisms, specific plant tissues and parts identified, the types of plants and environments where they are useful, and examples from archaeological contexts. it also explains how these analyses complement macroremains and contribute to understanding plant domestication, resource use, and processing techniques. in contrast, NEO offers a general overview without the depth of examples, mechanisms, or specific contextual information, making it less thorough overall."

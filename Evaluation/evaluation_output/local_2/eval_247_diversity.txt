  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a multi-faceted and comprehensive overview of various strategies for integrating math communication, including verbal and written explanations, collaborative activities, and communication-focused assessments. it discusses multiple angles such as fostering mathematical discourse, ongoing reflection through formative assessments, and embedding communication tasks into traditional assessments, thereby providing a richer set of perspectives. in contrast, NEO focuses primarily on group activities and student presentations, which makes it less varied in scope and perspective."

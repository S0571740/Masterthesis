  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive range of strategies for overcoming barriers and effectively communicating complex math concepts. it covers multiple approaches—including breaking down concepts, using analogies and visual aids, fostering interactive learning, tailoring explanations, organizing information clearly, and seeking feedback—offering a thorough and multi-faceted perspective. in contrast, MS is more succinct and focuses primarily on breaking down concepts and using simple language and visual aids, lacking the broader variety of methods and nuanced strategies present in NEO."

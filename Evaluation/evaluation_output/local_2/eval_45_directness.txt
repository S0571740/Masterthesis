DIRECTNESS:Q: Can you discuss the role of microwear analysis in complementing and validating the results from starch and phytolith analyses?

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly and thoroughly explains how microwear analysis complements and validates starch and phytolith analyses, providing specific details about the methods, their roles, and the benefits of integrating these approaches. in contrast, NEO is too vague and lacks specific information, making it less clear and less informative."

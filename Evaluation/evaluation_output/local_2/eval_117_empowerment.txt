{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the considerations and precautions when planning surgery for patients who have received bont-a injections. it discusses the importance of timing relative to the effects duration, impacts on muscle function and healing, potential influences on anesthesia management, and the need for multidisciplinary coordination. the inclusion of specific issues and their rationale helps the reader make informed judgments. in contrast, MS merely affirms that precautions are necessary without elaboration, reasoning, or supporting details, making it less informative and less helpful for understanding and practical application."

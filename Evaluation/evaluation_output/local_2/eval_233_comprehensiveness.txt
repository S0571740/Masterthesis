  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed, comprehensive explanation covering various strategies such as exploring different methods, using visual representations, translating between forms, reflecting on solutions, and encouraging creativity. it offers specific examples and insights that address the multifaceted aspects of engaging with math problems through multiple solutions and representations. in contrast, MS offers a brief overview without elaborating on specific techniques or strategies, making it less thorough and less aligned with the requirement for a complete and detailed response."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional approach to reinforcing math communication skills outside the classroom. it includes diverse strategies such as integrating math talk into daily routines, using real-world problems, employing games and puzzles, and modeling effective communicationâ€”all of which provide different perspectives and practical angles. moreover, it emphasizes the importance of reasoning, explanation, and teaching others, thereby covering behavioral, cognitive, and social aspects. in contrast, NEO, while mentioning activities, mainly focuses on encouraging explanations and using external resources, offering fewer varied insights and perspectives."

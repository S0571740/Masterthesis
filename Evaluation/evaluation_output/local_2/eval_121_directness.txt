  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed explanation of the mechanisms by which bont-a exerts its effects, including its inhibition of acetylcholine release, the involvement of snap-25, and how this knowledge can inform future research. in contrast, MS is brief and only mentions the general mechanism without elaboration or specific details. therefore, NEO is better because it addresses the question more specifically and clearly."

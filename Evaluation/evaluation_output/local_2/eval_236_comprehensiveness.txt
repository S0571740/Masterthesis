  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive discussion of specific strategies, such as encouraging children to explain their reasoning, creating math-rich environments with real-life activities, asking open-ended questions, and modeling effective communication. it elaborates on how these approaches support various aspects of math communication development, covering both practical applications and theoretical concepts. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without delving into specific methods or examples, making it less thorough and detailed."

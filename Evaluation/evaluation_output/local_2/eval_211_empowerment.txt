EMPOWERMENT:How can hydrological connectivity be used to inform the development of sustainable water management plans?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how hydrological connectivity can inform sustainable water management plans, including specific examples such as restoring floodplain connectivity and managing groundwater-surface water interactions. it also references practical implications and the importance of assessments in identifying vulnerable zones, supported by general hydrological principles and best practices. in contrast, NEO is more general, lacking specific examples, explanations, or evidence supporting how hydrological connectivity directly guides management strategies. therefore, MS offers a clearer, more informed, and practical understanding of the topic."

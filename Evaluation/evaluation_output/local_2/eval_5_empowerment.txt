  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a detailed, nuanced explanation of strategies policymakers can use, including prioritization, stakeholder engagement, evidence-based decision making, flexibility, and balancing relief with structural reforms. it offers specific methods and reasoning that help the reader understand how to approach the issue, supporting claims with examples and a comprehensive overview. in contrast, MS offers a more general summary without elaborating on how to implement these strategies or providing detailed reasoning or sources, making it less informative and less able to support informed judgment."

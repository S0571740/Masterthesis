{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a thorough and nuanced explanation, clarifying that current research is limited and emphasizing that no definitive biomarkers are established, while referencing ongoing studies and the potential for future discoveries. it avoids overstatement and clearly states the preliminary nature of current findings. in contrast, NEO is overly speculative, simply affirming the potential for biomarkers without discussing the current state of evidence or limitations, thereby providing less informative and potentially misleading guidance. therefore, MS better supports informed understanding with careful reasoning."

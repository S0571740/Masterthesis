{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a thorough and nuanced discussion of the limitations in existing research and specifically addresses how the study aims to fill multiple gaps, including methodological limitations, contextual factors, and the depth of analysis. it covers various aspects such as types of assessment, long-term impacts, and the role of instructional practices. in contrast, MS offers only a general statement about limited analysis and focus on specific age groups or educational levels, lacking the depth and breadth of detail seen in NEO."

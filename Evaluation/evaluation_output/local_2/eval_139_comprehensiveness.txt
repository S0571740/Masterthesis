COMPREHENSIVENESS:How do I optimize the surface chemistry of a chip to prevent particle fouling and improve sensing accuracy?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a much more detailed and comprehensive overview of strategies for optimizing surface chemistry, including specific techniques such as anti-fouling coatings (peg, zwitterionic polymers), surface charge adjustments, biomolecular functionalization, and various surface modification methods. it addresses multiple aspects of the question—preventing fouling, enhancing sensing accuracy, and ensuring compatibility with the environment—supporting its comprehensiveness. in contrast, NEO offers only a general overview without specific techniques or detailed explanations, making it less thorough."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a multi-faceted and in-depth exploration of the development of food-related technologies, incorporating archaeological evidence, specific examples of plant processing, analytical methods, and insights into trade and resource exchange. it offers multiple perspectives—technological innovation, resource use, ecological adaptation, and regional exchange—supported by diverse data and sources. in contrast, NEO offers a broad overview without detailed evidence or multiple viewpoints, making it less diverse and rich in perspectives."

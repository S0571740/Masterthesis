  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, detailed explanation of multiple strategies for integrating math communication, including specific examples like math journals, exit tickets, peer teaching, collaborative activities, and open-ended assessment questions. it discusses how these methods enhance understanding and reasoning and references general knowledge without making unsupported claims. in contrast, NEO offers a brief overview with fewer specifics and does not elaborate on how these strategies impact learning or assessment, making it less informative and less substantiated."

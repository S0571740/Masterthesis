  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a clear and concise list of specific risks and complications (false positives/negatives, contamination, sample handling, mutations, misinterpretation) directly related to the question. in contrast, MS, though thorough, is more detailed and elaborates on underlying causes and contextual information, thus being less concise and slightly less direct in listing potential risks."

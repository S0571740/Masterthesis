  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive, providing multiple aspects of how visual representations facilitate math communication, including their role in making abstract concepts concrete, supporting various learning styles, encouraging active engagement, and aiding articulation and collaboration. it also offers specific examples like graphs and charts, discusses bridging language barriers, and emphasizes the overall benefits for understanding and discussion. in contrast, MS is more general and less detailed, focusing mainly on visualization and comprehension without exploring broader functions or specific methods. therefore, NEO covers all relevant aspects with greater depth and clarity."

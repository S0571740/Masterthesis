DIVERSITY:How can students apply the concepts learned from this study to real-world problems in genomics and personalized medicine?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a multi-faceted and multi-dimensional perspective by exploring various strategies for applying genomic concepts in real-world problems, including technological methods, research trends, and ethical considerations. it incorporates different angles such as early-stage research dynamics, technological innovations, data-driven approaches, and societal implications, supported by specific examples and data references. in contrast, NEO primarily focuses on straightforward applications like analyzing genetic data and making treatment decisions, lacking the broader perspectives and multiple approaches present in MS."

DIRECTNESS:How does Olink Explore integrate protein data with genetic information?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly states that olink explore integrates protein data with genetic information by analyzing and correlating data from both sources, clearly addressing the question. while it is somewhat general, it avoids unnecessary details and focuses on the key point. in contrast, NEO provides extensive context and explanations but does not clearly specify how the integration occurs, making it less direct in answering the question."

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is more detailed and specifically addresses how research findings can influence various facets of math education policies and programs, such as curriculum development, teacher training, and resource allocation. it provides a clearer connection between research outcomes and practical policy applications. in contrast, NEO is more general and focuses on the importance of research without elaborating on how exactly these implications can be translated into specific policy or program components. therefore, MS offers a more comprehensive and relevant discussion related to the question."

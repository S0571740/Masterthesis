EMPOWERMENT:What are the potential risks and complications associated with combining surgery and BoNT-A therapy in pediatric patients?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive discussion of potential risks and complications, including considerations specific to pediatric patients such as growth and neuromuscular development. it also explicitly mentions the limited data available and emphasizes the importance of careful patient management, offering a more nuanced and balanced perspective. additionally, it references general medical literature, clinical guidelines, and pediatric studies, which helps support the claims and aids the reader in making informed judgments. in contrast, MS is more simplistic, listing typical risks without context or depth, and does not acknowledge potential limitations or the complexity of combining these treatments."

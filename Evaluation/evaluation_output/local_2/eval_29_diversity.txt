  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a multi-faceted, detailed, and multi-dimensional perspective on the study's findings. it discusses various aspects such as diverse plant use, technological methods, regional exchange networks, and subsistence strategies, thereby providing multiple angles on how the study expands knowledge. in contrast, MS provides a more general overview with limited specific details and fewer perspectives, making it less rich and varied in its insights."

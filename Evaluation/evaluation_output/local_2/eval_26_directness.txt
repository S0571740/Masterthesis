DIRECTNESS:Q: How does the presence of palm phytoliths indicate long-distance exchange networks?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed explanation linking the presence of palm phytoliths to long-distance exchange networks, including contextual information about the specific palms, their origins, and their significance in archaeological contexts. it clearly addresses how the identification of these phytoliths indicates imported materials and trade routes. in contrast, NEO offers a general and somewhat vague rationale without specific details, making it less clear and thorough in explaining how palm phytoliths specifically signal long-distance exchange."

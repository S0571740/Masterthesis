  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it details both qualitative and quantitative methods, providing specific examples such as spatial analysis, geospatial mapping, ethnographic studies, and community-based participatory research. it also discusses the application of longitudinal and mixed-methods designs, emphasizing their role in understanding changes over time and evaluating interventions. additionally, it references specific data sources like research studies, policy reports, community research, evaluation reports, and program evaluations, which enriches the explanation. in contrast, MS offers a more general overview of qualitative methods and study designs without the breadth of specific techniques or contextual applications, making it less detailed overall."

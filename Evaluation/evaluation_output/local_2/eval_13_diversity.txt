  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective on the teacher's role, including recognizing social factors, fostering emotional well-being through social-emotional learning, advocating for community resources, and promoting health literacy. it references multiple specific strategies and sources, adding depth and richness to the discussion. in contrast, NEO provides a more general overview with fewer specific insights and less diversity in approaches or perspectives, limiting its depth and breadth."

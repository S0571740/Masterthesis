  "reasoning": "MS provides a much more detailed and comprehensive explanation, addressing not only the lack of specific software mentions in the dataset but also elaborating on the types of tools used in practice, such as comsol multiphysics and ansys fluent. it contextualizes the question within the broader scientific community and explains the relevance of these tools, thereby covering all aspects of the inquiry thoroughly. in contrast, NEO offers only a simple yes/no statement without any additional detail, making it less comprehensive."

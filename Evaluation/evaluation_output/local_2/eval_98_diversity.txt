  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective by discussing various sectors (medical, regulatory, environmental) and considering factors such as safety, efficacy, cost, and policy implications. it also references specific medical applications of bismuth compounds, providing different angles on how its availability might influence public health strategies. in contrast, NEO provides a much narrower and general overview, focusing mainly on possible policy adjustments without exploring the broader or more detailed implications, evidence, or different viewpoints."

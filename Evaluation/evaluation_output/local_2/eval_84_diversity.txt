  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a comprehensive and multi-dimensional analysis, covering both benefits and limitations with specific scientific details, potential mechanisms, toxicity concerns, and references to research and data sources. it explores multiple perspectives, including efficacy, toxicity, stability, and the state of current research. in contrast, NEO provides a more superficial overview, mentioning only general benefits and limitations without detailed insights, supporting evidence, or exploration of different angles on the topic."

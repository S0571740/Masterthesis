  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed and comprehensive overview of the existing international standards and guidelines related to the quality and safety of direct naats, including specific references to who criteria and fda regulation, and explains their relevance. conversely, NEO is very brief and lacks specific details or examples, making it less thorough in covering all aspects of the question."

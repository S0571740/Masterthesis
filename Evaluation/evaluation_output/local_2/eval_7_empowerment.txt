{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a more comprehensive and nuanced explanation of how social workers can prioritize cultural sensitivity, including specific strategies such as understanding cultural norms, avoiding stereotypes, adopting a client-centered approach, and engaging in self-reflection. it also mentions the importance of ongoing education, community engagement, and references best practices and guidelines, which enhances its credibility and informs the reader more thoroughly. in contrast, MS is concise and covers key points but lacks depth and specific strategies, making it less effective in providing detailed guidance or facilitating informed judgment."

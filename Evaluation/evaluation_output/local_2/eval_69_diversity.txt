  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional perspective on how industry professionals can collaborate with researchers and clinicians. it covers various aspects such as multidisciplinary partnerships, technological innovations, clinical validation, regulatory pathways, device development, and integration of advanced technologies like ngs. it also offers concrete examples of existing systems and ongoing efforts, supported by references to entities and technologies, thus presenting multiple viewpoints and insights. in contrast, NEO is more general and less detailed, focusing mainly on resource sharing and combined expertise without exploring additional angles or providing specific examples and evidence."

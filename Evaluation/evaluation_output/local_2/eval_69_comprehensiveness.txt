  "reasoning": "MS provides a much more thorough and detailed exploration of how industry professionals can collaborate with researchers and clinicians to accelerate direct naat development. it covers various strategies such as establishing multidisciplinary partnerships, sharing technological innovations, supporting clinical validation and regulatory processes, and focusing on device usability and scalability. it also includes specific examples and mentions multiple key aspects like sample processing, device miniaturization, automation, regulatory pathways, and integration of advanced technologies. in contrast, NEO offers a brief, general overview without the detailed approaches, examples, or consideration of different collaboration facets, making MS clearly more comprehensive and complete."

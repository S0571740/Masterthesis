"reasoning": "NEO provides a more comprehensive and detailed discussion of the potential risks associated with frequent bont-a injections in children. it covers a range of adverse effects, including antibody development, muscle weakness, local side effects, systemic effects, and long-term safety concerns, offering context and explanation for each. in contrast, MS lists only a few risks without elaboration or consideration of multiple aspects, making it less thorough overall."

COMPREHENSIVENESS:Q: Can you explain how starch and phytolith analyses contribute to understanding plant-processing activities?

  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it provides detailed explanations of how starch and phytolith analyses contribute to understanding plant-processing activities. it discusses the types of evidence these microbotanical remains can reveal, such as specific plant taxa, processing methods, and the context of plant use, supported by examples and specific plant types. it also explains how these analyses complement each other and their significance in reconstructing ancient subsistence and technological practices. in contrast, MS offers a brief overview without the depth of detail or specific examples present in NEO."

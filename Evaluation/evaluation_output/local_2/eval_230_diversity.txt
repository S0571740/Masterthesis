  "reasoning": "NEO is more diverse and rich because it presents multiple strategies and perspectives for assessing math communication skills, including oral and written assessments, self and peer evaluations, portfolios, and the use of rubrics. it also emphasizes both the process and product of communication, considers multiple evidence sources, and incorporates different angles such as student reflection and collaborative assessments. in contrast, MS mainly lists assessment methods without elaborating on different perspectives or supporting evidence, making it less multi-faceted overall."

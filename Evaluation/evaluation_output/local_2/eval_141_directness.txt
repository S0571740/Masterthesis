  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses the question by providing specific information about standards and guidelines for labeling and disposing of used lab-on-a-chip devices, including references to biohazard classification, proper labeling, and disposal protocols. in contrast, MS is vague and does not specify any standards or guidelines, merely affirming their existence without details."

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of effective strategies for partnering with community organizations and policymakers. it emphasizes building relationships, ongoing communication, data-driven decision-making, and community input, all of which add depth and clarity to the guidance. additionally, it references specific concepts such as systemic inequities and mentions supporting data, which help the reader better understand the complexity of addressing concentrated disadvantage. in contrast, NEO offers a broad overview but lacks depth, specific strategies, or references that would support informed judgment and detailed understanding."

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective by detailing specific strategies such as prioritization, stakeholder engagement, evidence-based decision making, and policy flexibility. it covers multiple viewpoints—immediate relief, structural reform, stakeholder involvement, and adaptive policies—and illustrates them with concrete examples. in contrast, NEO provides a more general overview without exploring different angles or providing specific insights or evidence. therefore, MS demonstrates greater variety and richness in perspectives on balancing short-term needs with long-term goals."

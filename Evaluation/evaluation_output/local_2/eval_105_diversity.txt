  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted discussion covering various aspects such as muscle atrophy, morphological changes, growth and development, functional outcomes, and the importance of individualized management. it cites multiple types of evidence and perspectives, providing a richer and more detailed overview. in contrast, MS merely states the potential for long-term implications without elaboration or supporting references, resulting in a less diverse and informative response."

DIRECTNESS:Are there any alternative treatments or therapies that could be used in conjunction with BoNT-A to minimize side effects?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a clear and direct affirmation that alternative treatments or therapies exist and are available to minimize side effects when used with bont-a, directly addressing the question. in contrast, NEO is vague and lengthy, discussing general approaches without explicitly confirming the existence of such alternatives or listing them clearly. therefore, MS is more concise and specific in responding to the question."

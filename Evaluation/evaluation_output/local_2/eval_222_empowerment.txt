EMPOWERMENT:What are some strategies for using hydrological connectivity metrics to predict the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of strategies, including the integration of hydrological metrics into predictive models, use of long-term data, scenario analysis, and landscape-scale planning. it elaborates on how these strategies can be practically applied and links them to climate change impacts, offering clearer explanations and more context for informed understanding. conversely, MS lists general strategies but lacks depth, explanation, and references, making it less informative and potentially oversimplified for comprehensive understanding."

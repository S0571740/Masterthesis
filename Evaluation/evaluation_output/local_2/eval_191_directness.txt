DIRECTNESS:How can educators integrate the concepts and findings of this study into genomics and genetics curricula?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed and specific set of strategies for integrating the study into curricula, including examples of content, tools, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary approaches. in contrast, NEO is vague and generic, mentioning creating activities and discussions without offering concrete methods or examples. therefore, MS more clearly and specifically addresses how educators can integrate the study's concepts into curricula."

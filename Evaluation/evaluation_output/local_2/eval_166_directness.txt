  "reasoning": "NEO directly and thoroughly addresses the question by detailing specific technical limitations and challenges of using olink explore technology, such as sample matrix variability, detection limits, interference, antibody specificity, and assay competition. in contrast, MS is vague and less specific, mentioning only broad issues like data chunking and report generation without elaboration, making it less effective as a direct response."

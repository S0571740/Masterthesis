COMPREHENSIVENESS:What are some strategies for using hydrological connectivity metrics to predict the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of strategies to use hydrological connectivity metrics for predicting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. it covers multiple approaches such as integrating metrics into predictive models, utilizing long-term monitoring data, scenario analysis, and landscape-scale assessments, along with specific examples. conversely, MS offers only a brief overview, mentioning some key aspects but lacking the depth and variety of strategies discussed in NEO."

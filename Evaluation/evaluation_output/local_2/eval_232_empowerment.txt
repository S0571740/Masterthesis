EMPOWERMENT:How can I use visual representations to express math concepts more clearly?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive explanation of how visual representations can clarify math concepts, including specific examples such as graphs, diagrams, and geometric figures. it also discusses the benefits of visual tools in problem-solving and communication, supported by references to educational research and strategies, which enhances the credibility and informativeness of the explanation. in contrast, MS offers a more general overview without specific examples or supporting evidence, making it less detailed and less effective in helping the reader fully understand how visual representations can be used to express math concepts clearly."

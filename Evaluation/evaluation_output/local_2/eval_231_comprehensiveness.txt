COMPREHENSIVENESS:What are some effective ways to improve my mathematical language skills in class?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive overview of effective methods to improve mathematical language skills, including specific strategies such as annotating texts, practicing writing, learning from examples, using visual aids, and seeking feedback. in contrast, NEO offers a brief summary with only four general points, lacking the depth and variety of approaches included in MS. therefore, MS covers all the aspects more thoroughly and thoroughly addresses different techniques involved in skill development."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted discussion, including the functional role of microwear analysis, its relationship with microbotanical evidence, its ability to distinguish tool functions, and its contribution to understanding human-plant interactions. it also references multiple perspectives and provides context on how microscopy and residue analysis complement each other, showcasing a richer and more nuanced understanding of the topic. in contrast, MS is vague and lacks depth and additional perspectives."

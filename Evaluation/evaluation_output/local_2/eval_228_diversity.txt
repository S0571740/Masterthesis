{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multifaceted perspective by discussing multiple functions of visual representations in math communication, such as translating data, supporting various learning styles, bridging language barriers, and fostering collaborative reasoning. it also considers different formats (graphs, diagrams, charts) and the broader educational implications, including active engagement and clear articulation. additionally, it references educational research to support its points, demonstrating awareness of diverse perspectives and evidence. in contrast, MS provides a more limited perspective focused mainly on visualization of complex concepts, patterns, and connections, with less emphasis on the variety of perspectives and supporting evidence."}

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed overview of multiple resource options and support avenues, including online platforms, local programs, school-based resources, community events, and online communities. it explains how each resource can specifically support math communication skills and emphasizes strategies for using these resources effectively. in contrast, NEO offers a concise list of potential sources but lacks the depth and breadth of detail found in MS, making it less thorough in covering all relevant aspects of accessing support for improving math communication skills."

DIRECTNESS:Can direct NAATs be approved for CLIA waivers or other exemptions, and what are the requirements?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS directly addresses the question by confirming that direct naats can be approved for clia waivers and explicitly outlines the key requirements and regulatory criteria involved. in contrast, NEO provides only a vague statement that they 'meet the specific requirements outlined by regulatory authorities' without detailing what those requirements are, making it less clear and specific."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed explanation of technological innovations, regulatory support, and sample processing techniques that directly contribute to making naats accessible and affordable in low-resource settings. it cites specific devices, regulatory statuses, and scientific advancements, offering a comprehensive understanding of the subject. conversely, NEO focuses mainly on healthcare programs, partnerships, and financial aid without explaining the underlying technological or operational factors that influence accessibility and affordability. therefore, MS offers a more informed and detailed perspective."

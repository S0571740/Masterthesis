  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured approach to balancing math content and communication skills, including specific strategies such as incorporating discourse, adjusting curriculum design, and emphasizing professional development. it references multiple sources to support its recommendations, adding credibility and depth. in contrast, MS offers a more general suggestion without detailed reasoning, examples, or references, making it less informative and persuasive for informed judgment."

DIVERSITY:How can I ensure optimal outcomes and minimize recurrence of muscle spasticity after surgical intervention?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-dimensional perspective on ensuring optimal outcomes and preventing recurrence of muscle spasticity post-surgery. it covers preoperative planning, surgical techniques, postoperative management, long-term follow-up, and additional treatment considerations, incorporating various strategies, timelines, and evidence-based practices. in contrast, NEO is limited to just postoperative rehabilitation and medication adherence, with minimal exploration of other factors, multidisciplinary approaches, or detailed insights, making it less rich and multi-faceted."

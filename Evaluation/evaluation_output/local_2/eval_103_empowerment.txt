EMPOWERMENT:Are there any alternative treatments or therapies that could be used in conjunction with BoNT-A to minimize side effects?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned explanation of potential adjunct therapies and strategies to minimize side effects, including physical therapy, cooling techniques, precise injection methods, and imaging guidance, supported by general clinical practices. it also clarifies the lack of specific data in the provided tables, emphasizing reliance on clinical experience and guidelines. conversely, MS is overly brief and lacks substantive detail, reasoning, or sources, which diminishes its usefulness in helping the reader understand the topic and make informed judgments. therefore, NEO offers a clearer, more detailed, and better-supported explanation."

DIRECTNESS:What are some limitations of existing research on math communication skills, and how does this study address these gaps?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly identifies the limitations of existing research (lack of comprehensive analysis, focus on specific age groups or levels) and clearly states how the current study addresses these gaps (by providing a holistic perspective across age groups and educational levels). MS, while thorough and detailed, includes extensive contextual information and methodological insights that, although relevant to the broader research discussion, make it less concise and slightly less direct in explicitly pinpointing the specific limitations and the study's targeted contributions."

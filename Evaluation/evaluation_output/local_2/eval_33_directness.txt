DIRECTNESS:Q: What can be inferred about the seasonal calendar for gathering wild plant resources based on these findings?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly explains that the findings suggest a seasonal calendar for gathering wild plant resources, detailing how it was aligned with ecological factors, plant availability, and community strategies. in contrast, MS is vague and does not specify what can be inferred about the seasonal calendar; it only generalizes that it is an important aspect and provides no detailed or concrete information. therefore, NEO is more specific and clearly addresses the question."

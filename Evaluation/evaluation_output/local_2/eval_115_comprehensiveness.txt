COMPREHENSIVENESS:What are the indicators that a patient may require more frequent BoNT-A injections, and how often should they be reassessed?

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive discussion of both the indicators suggesting the need for increased injection frequency—such as symptom recurrence, inadequate control, and decline in benefit—and emphasizes the importance of individualized reassessment intervals, typically every 3 to 4 months. it elaborates on the rationale behind these intervals, highlights the need for tailoring the schedule to patient responses, and considers various clinical factors, making it more thorough and complete. in contrast, MS offers a concise overview but lacks the depth and nuance found in NEO."

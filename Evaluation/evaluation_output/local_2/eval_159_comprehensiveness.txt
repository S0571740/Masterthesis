COMPREHENSIVENESS:What is the role of NGS DNA tags in utilizing Olink Explore technology?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the role of ngs dna tags in olink explore technology, including their function as molecular identifiers, their attachment to pea probes, the process of pcr amplification, sequencing, and how they enable high-throughput, multiplexed protein detection. in contrast, MS offers only a brief mention that ngs dna tags enable identification and tracking during sequencing, lacking the detailed process and the specific role these tags play in the assay. therefore, NEO is better because it thoroughly covers all relevant aspects of the role of ngs dna tags."

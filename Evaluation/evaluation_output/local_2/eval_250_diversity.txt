  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-dimensional perspective by discussing various strategies such as professional development, curriculum alignment, leadership support, data-driven feedback, and cultural adaptation. it also considers different sources of evidence, including policy documents, assessment data, and community studies, providing a richer and more nuanced approach to scaling effective math communication. in contrast, MS, while covering important strategies, is more general and lacks the depth and diversity of viewpoints presented in NEO."

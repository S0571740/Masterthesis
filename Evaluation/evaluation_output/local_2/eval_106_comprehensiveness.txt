  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a thorough and detailed overview of the current guidelines, including specific aspects such as assessment, indications, dosing considerations, injection techniques, safety limits, monitoring for antibodies, and tailored frequency of administration. it covers all relevant facets of prescribing bont-a in children with spasticity, offering comprehensive guidance. conversely, NEO offers only a brief general statement about individualized treatment and injection frequency, lacking detailed guidance on assessment, dosing, technique, safety considerations, or monitoring, making it less complete."

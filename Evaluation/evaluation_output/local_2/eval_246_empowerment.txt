EMPOWERMENT:How can this research inform the development of curricula or educational programs focused on improving math communication skills?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the research can inform curriculum development, including specific strategies like explicit instruction, collaborative activities, and formative feedback. it also references various data points and explains how these can be integrated into educational programs, aiding the reader's understanding. in contrast, MS is overly vague and lacks specific reasoning, examples, or references that would help the reader critically assess how the research findings translate into practical curriculum design."

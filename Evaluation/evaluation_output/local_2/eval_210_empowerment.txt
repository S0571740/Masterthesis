EMPOWERMENT:In what ways can hydrological connectivity be used to design more effective wetland restoration projects?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a comprehensive, detailed explanation of how hydrological connectivity can be used in wetland restoration, including specific mechanisms such as water flow pathways, sediment transport, nutrient cycling, and ecological functions. it also references various data sources and examples, which help the reader better understand the concepts and evaluate their importance. in contrast, NEO offers only a broad overview without delving into specific processes or supporting evidence, making it less informative for someone seeking a thorough understanding."

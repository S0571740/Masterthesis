DIVERSITY:How can educators integrate the concepts and findings of this study into genomics and genetics curricula?

{
"winner": 1,
"reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a multi-faceted and detailed approach to integrating the study into curricula, including specific strategies such as using case studies, highlighting research infrastructure, applying bibliometric tools, addressing ethical considerations, and emphasizing real-world impact. it offers multiple perspectives—scientific, infrastructural, methodological, ethical—and connects these to educational activities. in contrast, MS is quite general and lacks specific insights, perspectives, or concrete methods, making it less diverse and rich in content."

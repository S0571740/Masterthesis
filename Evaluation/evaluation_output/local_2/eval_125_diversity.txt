  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive and multi-faceted discussion of emerging therapies and technologies, including pharmacological agents, neuromodulation techniques, regenerative medicine approaches, and assistive devices, along with explanations of their potential roles and developmental stages. in contrast, MS is vague and provides only a general statement without specific examples, perspectives, or evidence, making it less rich and varied in insight."

"reasoning": "MS is more comprehensive as it covers a wider range of strategies for prioritizing cultural sensitivity, including ongoing education, cultural competence training, direct engagement with community members, adopting a client-centered approach, avoiding assumptions, incorporating culturally relevant practices, collaborating with community leaders, and practicing reflection to assess biases. it also explains how these strategies contribute to building trust and delivering respectful services. in contrast, NEO provides a more general overview without detailing specific methods or principles like cultural humility or reflection, thus offering a less thorough coverage of the topic."

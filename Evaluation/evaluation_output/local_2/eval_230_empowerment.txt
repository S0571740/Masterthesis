  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of multiple assessment strategies, emphasizing the importance of both process and product evaluation, and suggesting specific methods such as rubrics, self-assessment, and portfolios. it clearly articulates how these strategies can help teachers evaluate communication skills effectively while supporting evidence-based practices. in contrast, MS offers a brief overview with fewer details and lacks specific strategies or sources, making it less informative and less structured in guiding effective assessment methods."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a clear and concise overview of how climate change impacts hydrological connectivity through changes in precipitation patterns and temperature regimes, directly addressing the question. in contrast, MS, while detailed and comprehensive, includes extensive elaboration, examples, and references that, although relevant, make it less concise and slightly less direct in responding to the key aspects of the question."

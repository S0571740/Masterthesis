  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a multi-faceted and detailed set of strategies, including exploring different methods, using visual representations, translating between forms, reflecting on solutions, and encouraging creative approaches. it offers specific examples and insights from educational research, pedagogical practices, and cognitive strategies, demonstrating a rich and varied perspective. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without specific techniques or supporting evidence, making it less diverse and insightful."

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly explains how healthcare professionals can utilize specific insights from the study, such as understanding gene-disease links and research trends, to improve patient outcomes. it provides detailed examples of application, making it clearer and more concrete. in contrast, NEO is vague and generic, mentioning integrating findings into practice without specifics, thus less directly addressing the question."

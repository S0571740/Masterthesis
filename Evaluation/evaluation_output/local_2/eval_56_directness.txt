"reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed and specific discussion of both the advantages and limitations of direct naats for poc testing, including mechanisms, examples, and technological considerations. in contrast, NEO is more general and brief, lacking specific details and explanations for each point, thus less clearly addressing the question with the desired depth and clarity."

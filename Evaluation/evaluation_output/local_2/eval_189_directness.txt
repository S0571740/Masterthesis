  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly addresses the question by emphasizing the importance of considering findings, evaluating implications, and ensuring transparency and accountability. it provides a clearer and more focused recommendation for policymakers specifically about how to incorporate findings into decision-making, whereas NEO offers general principles about evidence-based policy without explicitly tying them to the findings or giving as direct guidance."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-faceted exploration of potential interdisciplinary collaborations, including insights from education, cognitive science, linguistics, psychology, and technology. it discusses specific strategies and research approaches, references multiple disciplines and data sources, and highlights how these collaborations can lead to practical applications in teaching and learning. in contrast, MS presents a more general overview with fewer details and lacks specific examples or references, providing a narrower perspective."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it offers a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach with diverse strategies, including integrating math into daily life, asking open-ended questions, using games and puzzles, encouraging exploration, modeling positive attitudes, and creating a math-rich environment. it also discusses different perspectives—practical activities, cognitive engagement, emotional support, and environmental factors—providing a multi-dimensional view. in contrast, MS, while practical, is limited to activity-based suggestions and lacks the breadth of perspectives and detailed strategies present in NEO."

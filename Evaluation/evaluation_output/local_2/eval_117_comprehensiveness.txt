  "reasoning": "MS provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion on various important aspects, including timing of surgery relative to bont-a treatment, impact on muscle function and healing, implications for anesthesia and postoperative care, and the importance of multidisciplinary coordination. in contrast, NEO is very brief and lacks specific details, considerations, or explanations, making it significantly less thorough and complete in covering all relevant aspects of the question."

  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the principle behind magnetoresistive sensors, including the specific phenomenon of magnetoresistance, the influence of magnetic fields on electron spin, and how this affects resistance. it also offers a clearer comparison with other sensing technologies by mentioning specific alternatives like hall effect sensors and fluxgate magnetometers, and it discusses various advantages such as measurement range, robustness, and environmental resistance, supported by examples of applications. in contrast, MS offers a brief overview without detail or sources, limiting the reader's understanding and ability to evaluate the claims. therefore, NEO better helps the reader understand the topic and make informed judgments."

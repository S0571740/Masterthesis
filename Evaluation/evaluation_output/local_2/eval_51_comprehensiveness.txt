  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more thorough and detailed discussion of the challenges, including specific issues related to sample heterogeneity, inhibitors, sensitivity, and the necessity for standardized protocols. it cites particular sample types and interventions (e.g., mucolytic agents, heat pretreatment), offering depth across multiple facets of the question. in contrast, NEO is concise and mentions main challenges but lacks the elaboration, examples, and nuance present in MS, making it less comprehensive."

COMPREHENSIVENESS:What are the potential risks and complications associated with combining surgery and BoNT-A therapy in pediatric patients?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive overview of the potential risks and complications, including specific issues related to the combined use of surgery and bont-a in pediatric patients, such as muscle weakness, tissue effects, long-term implications, and factors specific to pediatric development. it also discusses management considerations. in contrast, NEO mentions several risks but remains at a general level with less detail on the specific interactions and potential complications unique to the combined approach, lacking depth and coverage of the full scope of possible issues."

DIRECTNESS:Q: What is the significance of globular/spheroid echinates originating from palms in archaeological ground stone implements?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses the significance of globular/spheroid echinates from palms in archaeological ground stone implements by explaining their archaeological and cultural implications. in contrast, MS incorrectly suggests that these phytoliths are significant mainly for enhancing tool grip, which is not supported by the typical significance of phytoliths in archaeological contexts. therefore, NEO provides a clear and relevant explanation related to the question."

EMPOWERMENT:How do I optimize the surface chemistry of a chip to prevent particle fouling and improve sensing accuracy?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed explanation of specific strategies for optimizing surface chemistry, including examples such as anti-fouling coatings, surface charge adjustment, and biomolecular functionalization. it also references well-established techniques and sources, offering the reader a comprehensive understanding of how to approach the problem. in contrast, NEO is more general, lacking specific methods, explanations, or references, making it less informative and less helpful for making informed decisions on surface chemistry optimization."

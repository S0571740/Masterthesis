COMPREHENSIVENESS:Are there any regulatory hurdles to overcome when using lab-on-a-chip devices in clinical settings?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a thorough and detailed explanation of the regulatory hurdles associated with lab-on-a-chip devices in clinical settings, including specific examples, approval processes, challenges related to validation, quality control, manufacturing standards, and ongoing compliance. in contrast, NEO offers only a brief acknowledgment without any detailed discussion or coverage of key aspects such as regulatory agencies, required validation, safety standards, or examples, making it significantly less comprehensive."

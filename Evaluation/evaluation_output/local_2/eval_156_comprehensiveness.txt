  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how olink explore benefits patient stratification and disease monitoring, including specific technological features (like pea, integration with ngs), coverage across biological samples, sensitivity to low-abundance biomarkers, validation processes, and applications in clinical studies. in contrast, MS offers only a broad overview without detailed mechanisms, technological specifics, or examples, making it less complete and thorough."

EMPOWERMENT:How will my child's response to BoNT-A injections be monitored, and what are the indicators of success or failure?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS provides a more comprehensive explanation of the monitoring process, including specific assessment tools like the modified ashworth scale, and clearly details how success and failure are determined through observable improvements and standardized assessments. it also emphasizes the importance of tailored evaluations and follow-up, offering a nuanced understanding that aids informed judgment. in contrast, NEO is more general and less specific about assessment methods and criteria, providing fewer details to understand how monitoring is conducted or how success and failure are precisely identified."

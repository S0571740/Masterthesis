COMPREHENSIVENESS:How can researchers apply the findings from this study to inform future investigations into math communication development?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it attempts to address how researchers can apply the study's findings by suggesting the integration of identified patterns and insights into future research, providing a direction for practical application. in contrast, NEO merely states a lack of information about the study, offering no substantive guidance or elaboration relevant to the question. while not highly detailed, MS at least engages with the question's core, making it the more comprehensive response."

  "reasoning": "NEO is more comprehensive because it details the specific roles of researchers in both development and evaluation phases, including identifying risk factors, designing and testing interventions, assessing effectiveness, understanding mechanisms of change, and facilitating translation into practice. it also discusses interdisciplinary approaches, innovative models, and real-world application, providing a thorough and complete overview. in contrast, MS offers only a brief statement about researchers' crucial role without elaborating on the specific aspects or steps involved, making it less detailed overall."

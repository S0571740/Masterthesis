  "reasoning": "MS provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of how community leaders can balance short-term needs with long-term goals by outlining specific strategies, principles, and practical examples. it emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, stakeholder engagement, data use, and phased approaches, thus offering the reader a clearer understanding of the complexities involved. in contrast, NEO is more general and lacks detailed reasoning, concrete examples, or references, making it less informative and potentially less helpful for informed judgment."

DIRECTNESS:How can this study's results be used to optimize resource allocation for genetic research initiatives?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it directly addresses how the study's results can be applied to optimize resource allocation by providing specific strategies, such as supporting underexplored genes, investing in emerging methodologies, and targeting certain research domains. in contrast, MS offers a vague and general statement about maximizing impact without specific, actionable details related to resource allocation."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed and thorough range of strategies for reinforcing math communication skills outside the classroom. it covers specific activities like everyday routines, real-world problem-solving, games, modeling communication, and encouraging teaching, thus addressing multiple aspects comprehensively. in contrast, NEO is more general and less detailed, mentioning activities like cooking, shopping, and using resources, but lacking deeper explanation of how these strategies develop communication skills or specific techniques to implement them. therefore, MS offers a more complete and nuanced explanation."

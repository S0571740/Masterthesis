{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "NEO is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed exploration of multiple strategies for balancing generalizability with context-specific findings, including mixed-methods, adaptable frameworks, contextual documentation, and iterative theory-practice dialogue. in contrast, MS offers a more limited overview, mainly emphasizing mixed methods and stakeholder collaboration, without elaborating on other important approaches or providing detailed explanations. therefore, NEO covers all relevant aspects more thoroughly and thoughtfully."

  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed, clear, and specific list of contraindications and precautions directly related to administering bont-a to pediatric patients. in contrast, NEO only offers a very brief and vague acknowledgment without listing specific contraindications or precautions."

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides detailed, actionable strategies with explanations rooted in educational principles, emphasizing how to incorporate math into daily life and foster curiosity, which helps the reader make informed judgements. it also refers to general research and educational practices, enhancing its credibility. in contrast, NEO offers helpful suggestions but is more brief and lacks detailed reasoning, sources, or explanations for why these approaches are effective. therefore, MS offers a more comprehensive and well-supported understanding of encouraging math conversations."

  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed and thorough explanation of how the findings from çatalhöyük relate to broader historical and cultural trends. it covers multiple aspects, including diverse food processing practices, technological innovations, resource diversification, trade networks, and their implications across different societies and time periods. in contrast, NEO offers only a superficial overview without elaborating on specific practices, examples, or broader patterns, making it less comprehensive."

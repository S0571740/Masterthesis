{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "NEO provides a detailed, clear, and directly relevant explanation that explicitly addresses how the study's results support or challenge previous interpretations of the site's farming economy. in contrast, MS is vague and lacks specific information, offering only a general statement without detailing how the results relate to prior understandings. therefore, NEO more effectively and specifically answers the question."

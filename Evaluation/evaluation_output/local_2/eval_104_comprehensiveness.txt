COMPREHENSIVENESS:How will my child's response to BoNT-A injections be monitored, and what are the indicators of success or failure?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of the monitoring process, including specific assessment methods, evaluation tools, and explicit indicators of success or failure. it discusses standardized scales, functional improvements, and potential signs of inadequate response, covering all relevant aspects of monitoring and success criteria. in contrast, NEO is brief and general, mentioning only broad indicators without detailing assessment methods or specific clinical tools, making it less thorough."

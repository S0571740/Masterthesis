{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it offers a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional perspective by detailing specific approaches such as explicit instruction on mathematical language, collaborative activities, and feedback mechanisms. it references multiple types of data and evidence sources, presenting different facets of how research can inform curriculum development. in contrast, NEO provides a more generic overview focused on identifying strategies without delving into varied insights, perspectives, or supporting evidence. therefore, MS demonstrates a richer and more diverse understanding of the question."

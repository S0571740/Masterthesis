{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed, multi-faceted approach to scaling up math communication strategies, including specific components such as professional development, curriculum alignment, leadership support, data utilization, and cultural adaptation. in contrast, NEO offers a more general list of strategies without elaborating on how these components should be implemented, adapted, or connected, resulting in less comprehensiveness and depth."

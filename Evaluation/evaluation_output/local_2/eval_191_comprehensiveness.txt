{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a detailed, multi-faceted approach to integrating the study's concepts into curricula, including specific strategies such as case studies, highlighting research organizations, using bibliometric tools, and addressing ethical considerations. in contrast, NEO offers a very general overview without elaboration or specific examples, making it less comprehensive in covering different aspects of integration."

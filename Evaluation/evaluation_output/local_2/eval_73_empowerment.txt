EMPOWERMENT:How can policy makers support the development and implementation of direct NAATs in low-resource settings?

{
  "winner": 2,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of how policy makers can support direct naat development in low-resource settings. it includes specific strategies such as regulatory approval processes exemplified by us fda-approved systems, targeted funding and incentives, capacity building and training, international partnerships, and integration into existing health infrastructure. it references specific examples and organizations, which enhances credibility and helps the reader understand practical applications. in contrast, NEO offers a more general overview without specific examples, sources, or detailed reasoning, making it less informative and less actionable."

DIRECTNESS:Can you discuss potential avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration to advance our understanding of math communication and its impact on student learning?

{
  "winner": 1,
  "reasoning": "MS is better because it directly suggests specific interdisciplinary collaborations (mathematicians, educators, communication experts, technology specialists, cognitive scientists, psychologists) and their relevance to understanding math communication and student learning. it is concise and addresses the question with clear examples. in contrast, NEO, while thorough and detailed, provides an overly broad and less focused discussion, including references and elaborate explanations that are unnecessary for a concise understanding of potential avenues for collaboration."

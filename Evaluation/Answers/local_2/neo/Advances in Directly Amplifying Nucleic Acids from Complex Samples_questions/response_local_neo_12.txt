The benefits of using direct NAATs for self-testing or home use include high accuracy in detecting the presence of a specific pathogen, convenience of testing at home without needing to visit a healthcare facility, and quick results that can lead to timely interventions. However, limitations may include the need for proper sample collection techniques to ensure accurate results, potential for user error in performing the test, and the possibility of false positives or negatives if not used correctly.

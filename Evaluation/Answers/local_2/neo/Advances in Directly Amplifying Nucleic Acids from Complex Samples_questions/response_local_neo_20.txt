Potential revenue streams for companies developing direct NAAT products could include sales of the testing kits, licensing agreements with healthcare facilities, subscription-based services for ongoing testing needs, and partnerships with insurance companies for coverage. Business models may involve a direct-to-consumer approach, B2B sales to healthcare providers, or a combination of both depending on the target market and distribution strategy.

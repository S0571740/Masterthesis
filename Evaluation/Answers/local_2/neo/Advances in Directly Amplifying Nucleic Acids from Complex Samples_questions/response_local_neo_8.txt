Direct NAATs can be integrated into existing clinical workflows and patient care pathways by ensuring that the testing process is streamlined and efficient. This can involve establishing clear protocols for sample collection, transportation, processing, and result reporting. Additionally, integrating direct NAATs may require training healthcare staff on how to properly conduct the tests and interpret the results within the existing workflow. Coordination with laboratory services and implementing electronic systems for result documentation and communication can also facilitate the integration of direct NAATs into patient care pathways.

Patients in low-resource settings can access and afford direct NAATs through various healthcare programs, initiatives, or partnerships that aim to provide subsidized or free testing services. Additionally, community health centers, government-funded healthcare facilities, or non-profit organizations may offer financial assistance or sliding scale fees to make NAATs more accessible to those in need. Furthermore, collaborations with international health organizations or donations from pharmaceutical companies can also help reduce the cost barrier for patients seeking NAATs in low-resource settings.

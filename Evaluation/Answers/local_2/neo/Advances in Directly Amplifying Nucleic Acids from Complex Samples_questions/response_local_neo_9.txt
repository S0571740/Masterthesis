Potential risks and complications associated with using direct NAATs in clinical settings include the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results, contamination leading to inaccurate results, the need for proper handling and storage of samples to prevent degradation, the potential for mutations affecting test accuracy, and the risk of misinterpretation of results without proper training or understanding of the test methodology.

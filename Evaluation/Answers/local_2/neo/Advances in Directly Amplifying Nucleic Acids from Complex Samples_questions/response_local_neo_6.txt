Advantages of using direct NAATs for point-of-care testing include high sensitivity and specificity, rapid results, and the ability to detect low levels of pathogens. Limitations may include the need for specialized equipment, trained personnel, and higher costs compared to other testing methods. Additionally, direct NAATs may have limitations in detecting certain strains or mutations of pathogens.

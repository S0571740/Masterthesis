Economic development should play a significant role in addressing concentrated disadvantage by creating opportunities for employment, increasing access to resources, and fostering community growth. It can be effectively implemented through targeted investments in infrastructure, job training programs, and support for small businesses in disadvantaged areas. Additionally, policies that promote inclusive economic growth and reduce barriers to entry for marginalized populations can help address concentrated disadvantage in a sustainable manner.

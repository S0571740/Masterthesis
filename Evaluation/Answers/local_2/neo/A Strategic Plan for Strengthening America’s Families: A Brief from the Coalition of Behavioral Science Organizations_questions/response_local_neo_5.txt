Policymakers can balance short-term needs with long-term goals in addressing complex social issues by implementing strategies that address immediate concerns while also laying the groundwork for sustainable, long-term solutions. This can involve investing in both short-term interventions to alleviate pressing issues and long-term initiatives that aim to address the root causes of the problems. By taking a comprehensive approach that considers both immediate needs and future goals, policymakers can work towards creating lasting positive change in society.

Researchers can balance the need for generalizability with the importance of context-specific findings by employing mixed methods approaches that combine quantitative data for generalizability with qualitative data for context-specific insights. This allows researchers to draw broader conclusions while also capturing the nuances and complexities of specific contexts. Additionally, researchers can collaborate with local stakeholders to ensure that findings are relevant and applicable to the specific social issues being addressed.

The most critical gaps in understanding concentrated disadvantage include the need for more comprehensive data collection methods, a deeper exploration of the intersectionality of various forms of disadvantage, and a better understanding of the long-term impacts of concentrated disadvantage on individuals and communities. Researchers can address these gaps by employing mixed-method approaches, conducting longitudinal studies, collaborating with diverse stakeholders, and incorporating a multidisciplinary perspective in their research efforts.

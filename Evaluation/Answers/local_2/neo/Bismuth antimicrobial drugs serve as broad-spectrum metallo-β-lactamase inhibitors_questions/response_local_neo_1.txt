The implications of using Bi(III) instead of zinc in NDM-1 binding would involve potential changes in the binding affinity, stability, and overall functionality of the NDM-1 enzyme. This substitution could impact the enzyme's ability to interact with substrates and inhibitors, potentially altering its catalytic activity and resistance to antibiotics.

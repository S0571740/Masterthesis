The structure of Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 differs from zinc-bound native NDM-1 due to the binding of Bi(III) instead of zinc in the active site of the enzyme. This alteration in the metal ion bound in the active site leads to changes in the coordination geometry and interactions within the enzyme structure.

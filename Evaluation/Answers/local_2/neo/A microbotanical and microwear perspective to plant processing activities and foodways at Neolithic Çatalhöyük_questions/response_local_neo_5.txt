Integrating microbotanical and microwear data with technological and contextual information is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of past human behavior and activities. This integration allows researchers to reconstruct ancient diets, subsistence strategies, tool use, and environmental interactions with more accuracy and detail. By combining these different types of data, researchers can paint a more complete picture of how ancient societies lived and adapted to their surroundings.

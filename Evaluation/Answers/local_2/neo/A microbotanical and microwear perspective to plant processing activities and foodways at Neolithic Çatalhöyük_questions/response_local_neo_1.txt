The presence of palm phytoliths can suggest long-distance exchange networks due to the fact that these microscopic silica structures are specific to certain palm species that may not naturally occur in a particular region. Therefore, finding palm phytoliths in an area where these palms do not grow naturally could indicate that they were brought to that location through trade or exchange networks.

Starch and phytolith analyses are important for understanding plant processing activities as they can provide insights into the types of plants being processed, the methods used for processing, and the potential uses of the processed plants. These analyses can help researchers identify the specific plant species involved, the techniques employed for processing, and the purposes for which the plants were processed. By studying starch and phytolith residues, researchers can gain valuable information about past plant utilization and human activities related to plant processing.

Parents can reinforce math communication skills outside the classroom by incorporating math into everyday activities, such as cooking, shopping, or playing games. Encouraging children to explain their thought process when solving math problems and asking open-ended questions can also help improve their math communication skills. Additionally, using math-related books, apps, and online resources can make learning more engaging and interactive.

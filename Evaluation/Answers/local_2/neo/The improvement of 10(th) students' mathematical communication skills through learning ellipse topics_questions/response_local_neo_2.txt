Teachers can incorporate contextual learning into their classroom instruction by using real-world examples and situations to teach math concepts. By connecting math to everyday experiences, students can better understand the relevance of what they are learning and improve their math communication skills. This approach helps students see the practical applications of math and encourages them to communicate their mathematical thinking in a meaningful way.

Teachers can enhance students' mathematical language skills by incorporating vocabulary-building activities, such as word walls, interactive games, and discussions. Encouraging students to explain their reasoning and solutions using mathematical terms can also help improve their language skills. Additionally, providing opportunities for collaborative learning and engaging students in real-world math problems can further develop their ability to communicate mathematically.

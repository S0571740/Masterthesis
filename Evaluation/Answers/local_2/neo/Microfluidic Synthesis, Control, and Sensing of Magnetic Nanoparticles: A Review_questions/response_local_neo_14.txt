To optimize the surface chemistry of a chip to prevent particle fouling and improve sensing accuracy, it is important to carefully consider the interactions between the chip's surface and the particles or molecules it will come into contact with. By modifying the surface properties through techniques such as functionalization or coating, you can tailor the surface chemistry to minimize fouling and enhance the accuracy of sensing mechanisms.

Magnetic sensors like GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistance) and TMR (Tunnel Magneto-Resistance) sensors differ in their underlying principles of operation and structures. GMR sensors rely on the change in resistance due to the orientation of magnetic layers, while TMR sensors utilize electron tunneling through an insulating barrier. These differences result in variations in sensitivity, power consumption, and overall performance of the sensors in different applications.

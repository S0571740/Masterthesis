To program a magnetophoretic circuit to transport particles at single-particle resolution, you would need to design the circuit in a way that allows for precise control over the magnetic field gradients. This control enables the manipulation of individual particles along the desired path within the circuit. By adjusting the magnetic field strength and direction at specific points in the circuit, you can effectively transport particles with single-particle resolution.

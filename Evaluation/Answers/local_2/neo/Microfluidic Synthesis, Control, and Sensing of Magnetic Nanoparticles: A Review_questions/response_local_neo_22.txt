Magnetoresistive sensors play a crucial role in single-biomolecule detection due to their ability to detect small changes in magnetic fields caused by the presence of biomolecules. Compared to other sensing technologies, magnetoresistive sensors offer high sensitivity and the capability to detect single molecules, making them a promising tool for applications requiring high sensitivity and precision in biomolecule detection.

Magnetoresistive sensors operate based on the principle of changes in electrical resistance in the presence of a magnetic field. This change in resistance is utilized to detect and measure magnetic fields. One of the key advantages of magnetoresistive sensors is their high sensitivity to magnetic fields, allowing for precise and accurate measurements. Additionally, they are known for their low power consumption, small size, and compatibility with various materials and environments, making them versatile for a wide range of applications.

Consider the specific requirements of your application, such as the range of magnetic field strength, resolution, size constraints, power consumption, and environmental conditions. Evaluate different types of magnetic sensors like Hall effect sensors, magnetoresistive sensors, and fluxgate sensors to determine which one best fits your needs based on these criteria.

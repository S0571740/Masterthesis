To troubleshoot common issues with magnetophoretic circuits and microfluidic chips, it is important to carefully inspect the connections and components for any loose connections or damage. Additionally, checking for proper alignment of the components and ensuring that the fluid flow is not obstructed can help in identifying and resolving issues. Calibration of the system and verifying the input parameters are also essential steps in troubleshooting such systems.

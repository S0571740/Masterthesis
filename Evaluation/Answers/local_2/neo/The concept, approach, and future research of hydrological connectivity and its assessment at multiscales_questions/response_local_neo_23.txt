Hydrological connectivity can influence the spread of invasive species and diseases in aquatic ecosystems under future climate scenarios by providing pathways for their movement between different water bodies. This connectivity can facilitate the dispersal of species and pathogens, allowing them to colonize new areas and potentially establish populations in regions where they were not previously present. In the face of changing climate conditions, altered hydrological patterns may further enhance the movement of invasive species and diseases, leading to potential ecological disruptions and impacts on native species.

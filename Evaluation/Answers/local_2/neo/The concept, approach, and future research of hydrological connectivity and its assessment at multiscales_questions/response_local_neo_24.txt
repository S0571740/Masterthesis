Changes in hydrological connectivity in the past have influenced water availability for human consumption and agriculture. For instance, alterations in the flow of rivers and streams due to changes in connectivity could have affected the amount of water accessible for drinking and irrigation purposes. Additionally, shifts in hydrological connectivity might have impacted the distribution of water resources, potentially leading to changes in water quality and quantity available for human and agricultural use.

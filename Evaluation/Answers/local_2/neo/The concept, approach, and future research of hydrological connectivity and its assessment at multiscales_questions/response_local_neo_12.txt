Changes in hydrological connectivity can impact water supply for human consumption and agriculture in various ways. For example, alterations in the flow of water between different water bodies can affect the availability and quality of water resources for drinking and irrigation. Changes in hydrological connectivity can also lead to shifts in the distribution of water, potentially causing water scarcity in certain regions and affecting agricultural productivity. Additionally, modifications in hydrological connectivity can influence the transport of nutrients and pollutants, which can further impact water quality and the suitability of water sources for human and agricultural use.

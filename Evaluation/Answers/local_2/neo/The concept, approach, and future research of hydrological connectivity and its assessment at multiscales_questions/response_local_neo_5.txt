Understanding hydrological connectivity can provide valuable insights into how water flows through different parts of a landscape, helping to identify areas where water resources are interconnected. This information can be used to make informed decisions about managing water resources more effectively, such as determining the best locations for water storage or identifying areas where water quality may be at risk. By considering hydrological connectivity, water resource management decisions can be more strategic and sustainable.

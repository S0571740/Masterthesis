Strategies for mitigating the effects of drought on hydrological connectivity may include implementing water conservation measures, such as reducing water usage, promoting efficient irrigation techniques, restoring wetlands and riparian areas, managing land use to prevent erosion, and implementing sustainable water management practices. Additionally, enhancing water storage capacity, implementing drought-resistant vegetation, and promoting groundwater recharge can also help mitigate the impacts of drought on hydrological connectivity.

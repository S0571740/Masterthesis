Climate change can potentially impact hydrological connectivity by altering precipitation patterns and temperature regimes. Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to shifts in the timing and intensity of rainfall, affecting the flow of water in rivers and streams. Additionally, variations in temperature regimes can influence the rate of snowmelt and the availability of water resources, ultimately impacting the connectivity of hydrological systems.

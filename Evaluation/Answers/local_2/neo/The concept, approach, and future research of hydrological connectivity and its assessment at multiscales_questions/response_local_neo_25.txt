Understanding hydrological connectivity can provide valuable insights into how water flows through different systems, which can help in developing adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities. By knowing how water moves between various components of the environment, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater, communities can better prepare for and mitigate the impacts of flooding, droughts, and other water-related challenges. This knowledge can inform decisions on land use planning, water resource management, and infrastructure development to enhance the resilience of vulnerable communities to hydrological risks.

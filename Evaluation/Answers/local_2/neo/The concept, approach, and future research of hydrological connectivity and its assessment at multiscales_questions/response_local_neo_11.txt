Understanding hydrological connectivity can provide valuable insights into how water flows through different systems, helping to identify areas where water management practices can be optimized for sustainability. By analyzing how water moves between various components of a landscape, such as rivers, wetlands, and groundwater systems, water managers can make informed decisions on how to protect water resources, prevent pollution, and ensure adequate water supply for both human and ecological needs. This knowledge can guide the development of effective water management plans that consider the interconnected nature of water systems and promote long-term sustainability.

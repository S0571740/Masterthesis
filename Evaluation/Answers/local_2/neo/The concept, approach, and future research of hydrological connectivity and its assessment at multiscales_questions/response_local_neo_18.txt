Hydrological connectivity can influence nutrient cycling and primary production in aquatic ecosystems by facilitating the movement of nutrients, organic matter, and organisms between different parts of the ecosystem. This connectivity can enhance the availability of nutrients in certain areas, leading to increased primary production. Additionally, it can impact the distribution of species and the overall biodiversity within the ecosystem, further influencing nutrient cycling processes.

Climate change can impact hydrological connectivity by altering precipitation patterns, increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and influencing the timing of snowmelt and glacier melt. These changes can lead to shifts in water availability, changes in streamflow patterns, and alterations in the connectivity between different water bodies. The potential consequences of these alterations include increased flooding, changes in water quality, disruptions to ecosystems and habitats, and challenges for water resource management and agriculture.

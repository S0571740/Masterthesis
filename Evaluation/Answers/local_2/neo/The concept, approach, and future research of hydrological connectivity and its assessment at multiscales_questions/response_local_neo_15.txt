Hydrological connectivity can be utilized to optimize water allocation and reduce conflicts among stakeholders by facilitating a better understanding of how water flows through different systems. This understanding can help in identifying opportunities for more efficient water distribution, ensuring that water resources are allocated in a sustainable and equitable manner. By considering hydrological connectivity, stakeholders can work together to develop strategies that take into account the interconnected nature of water systems, ultimately leading to more effective water management practices and reduced conflicts over water allocation.

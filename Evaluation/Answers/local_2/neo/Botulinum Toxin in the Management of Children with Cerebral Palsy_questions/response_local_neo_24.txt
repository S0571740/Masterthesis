Repeated BoNT-A injections in children may have long-term implications on muscle development and function. Future research could focus on investigating the effects of these injections on muscle growth, strength, and overall function over an extended period. Understanding the impact of BoNT-A injections on muscle development in children could help in developing strategies to mitigate any potential negative effects and optimize treatment outcomes.

You can integrate BoNT-A injections as part of a comprehensive treatment plan for patients with muscle spasticity by considering the patient's medical history, conducting a thorough physical examination, identifying specific muscles to target for injections, determining the appropriate dosage of BoNT-A, monitoring the patient for any side effects or changes in spasticity, and coordinating with other healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care to ensure a holistic approach to managing muscle spasticity.

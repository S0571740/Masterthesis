BoNT-A exerts its effects on muscle spasticity in pediatric patients by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle relaxation. Understanding these mechanisms can guide future research in developing more targeted and effective treatments for muscle spasticity in pediatric patients.

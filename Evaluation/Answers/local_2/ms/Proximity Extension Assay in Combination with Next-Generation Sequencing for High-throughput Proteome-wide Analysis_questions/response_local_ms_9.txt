The role of NGS DNA tags in utilizing Olink Explore technology is central to enabling high-throughput protein analysis. Olink Explore combines proximity extension assay (PEA) technology with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to facilitate the simultaneous detection and quantification of nearly 1,500 proteins from minimal sample volumes. In this system, each protein target is associated with a unique DNA oligonucleotide, known as an NGS DNA tag, which is attached to PEA probes.

During the assay, these DNA tags serve as molecular identifiers that are released and amplified through PCR after the PEA probes bind to their respective target proteins. The amplified DNA tags are then sequenced using NGS platforms, such as Illumina's NovaSeq. This sequencing readout allows for precise quantification of each protein based on the number of DNA tags detected, providing a scalable and highly multiplexed approach to proteomics. 

In essence, NGS DNA tags act as barcodes that translate protein detection events into DNA sequences, which can be read out rapidly and accurately by NGS technology. This integration significantly enhances the capacity for large-scale, sensitive, and specific protein profiling, supporting biomarker discovery and clinical research [Data: Entities (2033, 2120); Relationships (616, 674)].

The provided data does not include specific information about the cost-effectiveness of Olink Explore compared to other proteomics technologies. However, some insights can be inferred based on the technological features and operational efficiencies described.

Olink Explore utilizes a highly multiplexed approach combining proximity extension assay (PEA) technology with next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows for the simultaneous measurement of nearly 1,500 proteins from minimal sample volumes [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616, 674)]. This high-throughput capacity can potentially reduce per-sample costs by enabling large-scale analyses within a single run, especially when compared to traditional methods that analyze fewer proteins at a time. Additionally, the platform's integration with automation and miniaturization techniques, such as the use of liquid handling robots, minimizes reagent consumption and sample volume, further lowering operational costs [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (611, 616)].

In contrast, other proteomics methods like Bio-Plex, MSD, and Luminex platforms often require more reagents, larger sample volumes, and may have lower multiplexing capacities, which can increase costs per analyte analyzed. The data shows that Olink Explore has competitive intraassay precision (CV around 7-8%) and limited interference from heterophilic antibodies, which can reduce the need for repeat testing and improve overall cost-efficiency [Data: Relationships (611, 616, 674)]. 

While direct cost comparisons are not provided, the combination of high multiplexing, automation, and minimal sample requirements suggests that Olink Explore could be more cost-effective for large-scale biomarker discovery and clinical research applications. Nonetheless, the actual cost-effectiveness would depend on specific project needs, sample throughput, and the scope of analysis, which are not detailed in the current data.

This assessment is supported by the platform's design focus on high throughput and efficiency, which are key factors in reducing overall costs in proteomics research [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616, 674)].

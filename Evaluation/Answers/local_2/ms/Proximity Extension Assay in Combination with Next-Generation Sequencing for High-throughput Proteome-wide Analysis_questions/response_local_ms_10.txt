Olink Explore has the potential to significantly enhance patient care and treatment outcomes through its advanced proteomics capabilities. By enabling high-throughput, sensitive, and specific measurement of nearly 1,500 proteins across various biological samples, the platform facilitates the discovery and validation of novel biomarkers. These biomarkers can be used for early disease diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring, which are critical for personalized medicine approaches [Data: Entities (2120); Descriptions of platform applications].

One of the key advantages of Olink Explore is its ability to analyze a broad dynamic range of proteins, including low-abundance biomarkers that are often missed by traditional methods. This comprehensive profiling can lead to a better understanding of disease mechanisms, enabling clinicians to tailor treatments based on individual molecular profiles. For example, the platform has been used to identify unique protein signatures associated with COVID-19 outcomes, providing insights into disease progression and potential therapeutic targets [Data: Reports (40); Supplemental data].

Furthermore, the integration of NGS technology into Olink Explore enhances multiplexing capacity, allowing for the simultaneous analysis of hundreds of proteins from minimal sample volumes. This efficiency supports rapid and cost-effective testing, which can be crucial in clinical settings where timely decision-making is essential. The platform's robustness and reproducibility, validated through extensive research and validation efforts, ensure reliable results that can inform clinical decisions [Data: Relationships (616); Entities (2223)].

In addition, Olink Explore's ability to differentiate protein levels in different sample matrices, such as plasma and serum, allows for flexible sample collection and analysis, broadening its applicability in various clinical scenarios. Its use in large-scale studies, including those investigating obesity-related biomarkers and COVID-19, demonstrates its capacity to generate meaningful insights that can improve patient stratification, treatment selection, and monitoring of therapeutic responses [Data: Reports (40); Supplemental data].

Overall, Olink Explore's technological innovations support more precise, personalized, and timely healthcare interventions, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of disease [Data: Entities (2120); Descriptions of platform applications].

The use of Olink Explore technology, while highly advanced and capable of high-throughput protein detection, faces several technical limitations and challenges that impact its performance and data interpretation.

One significant challenge is the variability introduced by differences in sample matrices, such as plasma and serum. Although both are derived from blood, their distinct preparation processes—plasma being anticoagulated blood and serum being clot-derived—can lead to differences in protein abundance measurements. For example, VEGF levels can vary more than eightfold between these matrices, which complicates cross-sample comparisons and necessitates careful interpretation of results [Data: Proteins (115); Serum and Plasma (most proteomic analyses)].

Another challenge involves the detection limits and reproducibility of the platform. While Olink Explore demonstrates a high detectability rate of over 80% for most proteins, some assays, especially those targeting low-abundance proteins, may fall below the limit of detection, affecting sensitivity. The platform's intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) is generally low (around 7-9%), indicating good precision, but variability can still occur, especially when dealing with very low or very high protein concentrations [Data: Proteins (115); Technical assessment (6)].

Interference from heterophilic antibodies, such as IgG, can also pose problems. Although the platform shows limited interference with most assays, some proteins like VEGFA and IL6 exhibit more substantial interference, which can lead to false positives or inaccurate quantification. This interference must be accounted for during data analysis to avoid misleading conclusions [Data: Serum and Plasma; Interference (6)].

Additionally, the technology's reliance on antibody-based detection and DNA extension in PEA probes introduces potential issues related to antibody specificity and cross-reactivity. Custom-developed antibodies are used to ensure specificity, but cross-reactivity or non-specific binding can still occur, potentially affecting assay accuracy and reproducibility [Data: Proteins (115); Antibody development process].

Finally, the high multiplexing capacity, while advantageous, can lead to assay competition and signal suppression, especially when high-abundance proteins dominate the sample. To mitigate this, samples are divided into different pools based on protein abundance, adding complexity to sample preparation and data normalization processes [Data: Proteins (115); Library preparation protocols].

In summary, while Olink Explore offers powerful high-throughput proteomics capabilities, challenges such as matrix effects, detection limits, interference, antibody specificity, and assay competition must be carefully managed to ensure accurate and reproducible data [Data: Serum and Plasma; Technical assessment (6)]. Ongoing improvements in assay design, validation, and data normalization are essential to address these limitations effectively.

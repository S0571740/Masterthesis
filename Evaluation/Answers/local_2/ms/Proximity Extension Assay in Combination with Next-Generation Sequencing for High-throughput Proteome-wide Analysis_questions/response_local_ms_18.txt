Yes, Olink Explore can be integrated with other omics technologies, including genomics and transcriptomics, to facilitate comprehensive multi-omics research. The platform's high-throughput protein detection capabilities complement genomic and transcriptomic data, enabling a more complete understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.

Specifically, Olink Explore utilizes NGS DNA tags for protein quantification, which aligns well with genomic sequencing technologies like Illumina's NovaSeq 6000 platform. This integration allows researchers to perform simultaneous genomic and proteomic analyses from the same samples, supporting multi-omics workflows that can reveal correlations between genetic variants, gene expression, and protein levels [Data: Entities (2120, 2034); Relationships (616, 674)]. Additionally, the platform's ability to analyze proteins at the single-cell level and in various sample matrices enhances its utility in transcriptomics studies, especially when combined with single-cell transcriptomic approaches that analyze gene expression at the cellular level [Data: Entities (1353); Relationships (612)].

The interconnected relationships among these technologies highlight a collaborative ecosystem where genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data can be integrated to provide a more detailed biological picture. This approach is increasingly important in personalized medicine, biomarker discovery, and understanding complex diseases, as it allows for cross-validation and comprehensive pathway analysis. Overall, Olink Explore's compatibility with other omics platforms makes it a valuable component of multi-omics research strategies [Data: Relationships (616, 674); Entities (2034, 2120)].

In summary, Olink Explore is designed to work alongside other omics technologies, leveraging its NGS-based protein analysis to complement genomic and transcriptomic data, thereby enabling holistic biological insights.

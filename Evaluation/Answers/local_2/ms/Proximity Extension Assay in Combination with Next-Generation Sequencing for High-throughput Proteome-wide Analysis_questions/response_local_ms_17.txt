Olink Explore integrates seamlessly into existing research frameworks and pipelines by combining advanced proteomics technology with high-throughput sequencing (NGS), enabling comprehensive and scalable protein analysis. The platform is designed to facilitate biomarker discovery, disease research, and clinical diagnostics, supporting multi-omics approaches that are increasingly common in biomedical research.

One key aspect of its integration is the use of NGS DNA tags as a readout, which allows Olink Explore to analyze nearly 1,500 proteins simultaneously with high sensitivity and specificity [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616, 613, 674)]. This capability aligns well with current research workflows that leverage NGS for genomic and transcriptomic data, enabling researchers to perform combined genomic and proteomic analyses from the same samples. The platform's compatibility with existing sequencing infrastructure, such as Illumina's NovaSeq systems, further facilitates its incorporation into established pipelines for large-scale studies.

Additionally, Olink Explore's use of PEA (Proximity Extension Assay) technology, which employs antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, provides high multiplexing capacity and precise quantification, making it suitable for integration with bioinformatics and data analysis pipelines that handle complex datasets. The platform's robust normalization and QC controls, including internal and external controls, ensure data quality and reproducibility, which are critical for research standardization and validation processes [Data: Sources (115); References in the supplemental data].

Furthermore, the platform supports automation and miniaturization, reducing sample volume requirements and reagent costs, which enhances throughput and scalability within existing laboratory workflows. The use of liquid handling robots like Mosquito LV and Dragonfly Discovery in sample preparation exemplifies how Olink Explore can be integrated into automated pipelines, streamlining sample processing and data generation.

In summary, Olink Explore complements existing research frameworks by providing a high-throughput, scalable, and precise proteomics solution that integrates with NGS-based workflows, supports multi-omics studies, and adheres to rigorous quality standards, thereby enhancing the depth and breadth of biomedical research [Data: Relationships (616, 674); Entities (2120)].

The adoption of Olink Explore technology, while offering significant advancements in high-throughput proteomics, also presents several potential risks and challenges that organizations should consider. One primary concern is the complexity of integrating this advanced platform into existing laboratory workflows. Given its reliance on sophisticated NGS technology and multiplexed assays, laboratories may face hurdles related to technical expertise, equipment compatibility, and operational adjustments. This could lead to increased initial setup costs and a learning curve for personnel unfamiliar with NGS-based proteomics [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616)].

Another challenge involves data interpretation and standardization. The high sensitivity and multiplexing capacity of Olink Explore generate large volumes of complex data, which require robust bioinformatics tools and expertise for accurate analysis. Variability in sample matrices, such as differences between plasma and serum, can also impact results, potentially complicating cross-study comparisons and clinical interpretations. Ensuring reproducibility and consistency across different laboratories and studies remains a significant hurdle, especially when considering the platform's high sensitivity and dynamic range [Data: Entities (2120); Descriptions of platform applications].

Cost considerations are also notable. While miniaturization and automation reduce reagent volumes and increase throughput, the overall investment in equipment, training, and maintenance can be substantial. Additionally, the need for specialized consumables and sequencing infrastructure, such as Illumina's NovaSeq systems, may limit accessibility for smaller or resource-constrained laboratories. These financial and logistical barriers could slow widespread adoption, particularly in clinical settings where cost-effectiveness is critical [Data: Entities (2120); Descriptions of platform integration].

Finally, regulatory and validation challenges pose risks for clinical implementation. As the platform is used increasingly for biomarker discovery and diagnostic purposes, rigorous validation, standardization, and regulatory approval processes must be navigated. The involvement of researchers like Lotta Wik in validation efforts underscores the importance of scientific credibility, but achieving regulatory compliance can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Any discrepancies in assay performance or reproducibility could impact clinical trust and adoption [Data: Relationships (682); Entities (2223); Descriptions of validation activities].

In summary, while Olink Explore offers transformative potential for proteomics research and diagnostics, challenges related to technical integration, data management, costs, and regulatory approval must be carefully managed to mitigate risks associated with its adoption.

Olink Explore enables high-throughput analysis of nearly 1500 proteins in multiplex primarily through its innovative combination of proximity extension assay (PEA) technology and next-generation sequencing (NGS). This integration allows for the simultaneous detection and quantification of a broad range of proteins with high sensitivity and specificity, making it suitable for large-scale biomarker discovery and disease research [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (681, 682)].

The platform utilizes PEA probes, which are antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates designed to bind specifically to target proteins. When two PEA probes bind in close proximity to the same protein, their attached oligonucleotides hybridize and are extended, creating a unique DNA barcode for each protein. These DNA barcodes are then amplified and quantified via NGS, enabling the detection of hundreds to thousands of proteins in a single assay. This approach significantly enhances multiplexing capacity while maintaining assay robustness [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616, 613)].

Furthermore, Olink Explore employs advanced sample preparation protocols, including sample dilution and automation with liquid handling robots, to optimize assay performance and reduce reagent consumption. The platform's design divides probes into different pools based on protein abundance, which helps manage the wide dynamic range of plasma proteins and ensures accurate measurement across the proteome. The use of NGS as a readout allows for high-throughput data generation, with the ability to process large sample sets efficiently [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616)].

In summary, Olink Explore's high multiplexing capability stems from its innovative PEA technology combined with NGS, sophisticated sample handling, and assay design strategies that enable the simultaneous analysis of nearly 1500 proteins with high precision and throughput [Data: Entities (2120); Relationships (616, 674)].

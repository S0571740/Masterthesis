Yes, Olink Explore is well-equipped to assist in identifying novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. The platform's high-throughput proteomics technology, which combines proximity extension assay (PEA) with next-generation sequencing (NGS), enables the comprehensive analysis of nearly 1,500 proteins across various biological samples, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue, and aqueous humor [Data: Entities (2120); Reports (40)]. This extensive coverage allows researchers to detect subtle changes in protein levels that may serve as early indicators of disease or as markers for monitoring disease progression.

Olink Explore's sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range are particularly advantageous for biomarker discovery. Its ability to analyze low-abundance proteins with high precision supports the identification of novel biomarkers that might be missed by other methods. The platform's validation efforts, including work by researchers like Lotta Wik, ensure the reliability and reproducibility of the data, which are critical for translating findings into clinical applications [Data: Relationships (682); Entities (2223)]. Furthermore, the platform's integration with NGS technology enhances multiplexing capacity, allowing simultaneous measurement of hundreds of proteins, thus facilitating large-scale biomarker screening studies.

The platform has already demonstrated its utility in various disease contexts, including COVID-19, where it uncovered unique protein signatures predictive of disease outcomes, and in studies of obesity-related biomarkers, where it identified proteins associated with BMI and metabolic health [Data: Reports (40); Supplemental data]. These examples underscore Olink Explore's potential to discover novel biomarkers that can improve early diagnosis, enable personalized treatment strategies, and monitor disease progression more effectively. Overall, Olink Explore's technological capabilities and validated performance make it a powerful tool for advancing biomarker research in clinical settings.

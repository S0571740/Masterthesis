Industry professionals can play a pivotal role in collaborating with researchers and clinicians to accelerate the development of direct nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) by fostering multidisciplinary partnerships, sharing technological innovations, and supporting clinical validation efforts.

One effective approach is to establish joint research initiatives that combine industry expertise in device engineering, sample processing, and assay development with the clinical insights and needs identified by healthcare providers. For example, ongoing efforts to create portable, integrated platforms for point-of-care testing, such as those developed by companies like TwistDx, Enigma Diagnostic, and BioMerieux, can benefit from industry input to optimize usability, robustness, and scalability [Data: Entities (1585, 1586, 1587); Relationships (520, 521, 522)]. Collaborations can also focus on streamlining sample preparation methods, such as heat-based pretreatments and chemical protocols, to improve sensitivity and reduce complexity, which are critical for real-world applications [Data: Entities (1731); Relationships (551)].

Furthermore, industry can support the validation and regulatory approval process by working closely with clinicians and regulatory bodies like the US FDA. For instance, systems like Alere i, which perform NAATs without prior nucleic acid extraction and have received FDA CLIA-waived status, exemplify how industry can facilitate regulatory pathways for innovative direct testing platforms [Data: Entities (1584); Relationships (518, 519)]. Engaging in joint clinical studies to demonstrate performance in diverse settings can expedite adoption and trust in these technologies.

Finally, industry professionals can contribute to the development of user-friendly, cost-effective, and robust devices by investing in miniaturization, automation, and high-throughput capabilities. This includes integrating advanced sequencing and proteomics technologies, such as NGS-based readouts used by platforms like Olink Explore, to enhance multiplexing and biomarker discovery, which can inform the design of more precise and versatile direct NAATs [Data: Entities (2033, 2041); Relationships (612, 663)].

In summary, collaborative efforts that combine technological innovation, clinical validation, regulatory navigation, and user-centered design are essential for accelerating the deployment of effective, accessible direct NAATs. Such partnerships can bridge gaps between research and practical application, ultimately improving infectious disease diagnostics and patient outcomes.

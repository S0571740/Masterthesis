Based on the provided data, there are no specific references to international standards or guidelines explicitly dedicated to ensuring the quality and safety of direct nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). However, there are relevant references to overarching guidelines and criteria that influence the development and evaluation of diagnostic tools, including NAATs.

The World Health Organization (WHO) plays a significant role in setting standards and criteria for diagnostics, including those for infectious diseases like tuberculosis. The WHO has established criteria such as the ASSURED principles, which emphasize affordability, sensitivity, specificity, user-friendliness, rapidity, equipment-free operation, and deliverability. These criteria serve as a framework for developing effective diagnostics and are supported by the WHO's endorsement of NAATs for tuberculosis detection [Data: Entities (568); Sources (86)].

Furthermore, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates and approves NAATs to ensure their safety and efficacy, including systems like Alere i that perform NAATs without requiring nucleic acid extraction. The FDA's regulatory oversight acts as a benchmark for quality assurance, although it primarily pertains to the United States rather than international standards [Data: Entities (1583, 1584); Relationships (518, 519)].

In summary, while there are no explicit international standards solely dedicated to direct NAATs in the provided data, the WHO's criteria and endorsements, along with FDA regulatory practices, serve as important references for quality and safety assurance in the development and deployment of these diagnostic technologies.

This is supported by references to WHO's diagnostic criteria and endorsements [Data: Entities (568); Sources (86)] and FDA's regulatory oversight [Data: Entities (1583, 1584); Relationships (518, 519)].

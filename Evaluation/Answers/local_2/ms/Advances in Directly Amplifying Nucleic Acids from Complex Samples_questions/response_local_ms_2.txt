The performance of direct nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) is significantly influenced by the type of biological matrix used, as each matrix presents unique challenges and advantages for nucleic acid detection. 

Blood-based samples, such as serum and plasma, are often used in diagnostics, but they contain inhibitors and low-abundance analytes that require high sensitivity. Heat-based pretreatment can improve nucleic acid release from these samples, with heat pre-treatment producing up to a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity for certain assays like LAMP [Data: Sources (36, 60, 123-126)]. The high water content in saliva makes it relatively easier to augment the concentration of target nucleic acids, and direct amplification methods have been successfully applied with minimal sample processing. For example, dried saliva swabs can be directly added to reaction mixtures, circumventing DNA extraction and purification steps [Data: Sources (93, 145, 148-150)].

Sputum, a common sample for respiratory infections such as tuberculosis, is more heterogeneous and viscous, often requiring complex sample preparation involving mucolytic agents like N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NALC) and DTT, as well as detergents and proteolytic enzymes to break down mucus and release nucleic acids [Data: Sources (138, 139)]. Despite these challenges, direct amplification from sputum has been achieved, especially when combined with heat pretreatment, which enhances nucleic acid release and detection sensitivity. For instance, heat pretreatment combined with specific reagents has enabled detection limits as low as 2 fg of bacterial DNA in sputum [Data: Sources (145)].

In contrast, saliva, which is easier to collect and handle, has been used successfully in direct PCR and LAMP assays, often with minimal processing. Techniques such as dried saliva collection and simple dilution into reaction reagents have been employed to avoid complex extraction steps, making saliva a promising matrix for point-of-care testing [Data: Sources (87, 146, 147, 93)]. 

Overall, matrices like blood require more intensive sample preparation due to inhibitors and low target concentrations, whereas saliva and sputum can be used more directly, especially with heat pretreatment or simple dilutions. The choice of matrix and sample processing method directly impacts the sensitivity, specificity, and practicality of point-of-care NAATs, with ongoing research aimed at simplifying workflows for diverse sample types [Data: Sources (36, 60, 145, 138, 139, 93, 146, 147)].

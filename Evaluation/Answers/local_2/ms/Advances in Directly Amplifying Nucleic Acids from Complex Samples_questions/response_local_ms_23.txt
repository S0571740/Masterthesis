Policy makers can play a crucial role in supporting the development and implementation of direct nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in low-resource settings by establishing a comprehensive regulatory and funding framework. One of the key steps is to facilitate regulatory approval processes that ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of portable and simplified NAAT systems, such as those that bypass complex sample preparation steps [Data: Entities (1582, 1583); Relationships (518)]. For example, the US FDA has approved systems like Alere i, which performs NAATs without prior nucleic acid extraction, demonstrating the importance of regulatory endorsement in fostering trust and adoption [Data: Entities (1584); Relationships (519)].

Furthermore, policy makers can allocate targeted funding and incentives to encourage research and development of affordable, user-friendly, and robust diagnostic platforms suitable for resource-limited environments. Supporting initiatives that focus on creating portable, integrated, and direct testing platforms can accelerate their deployment at the point of care, especially in rural or underserved areas [Data: Entities (1597); Relationships (525)]. Investment in local manufacturing and supply chains can also reduce costs and improve access to these technologies.

In addition, policy makers should promote capacity building and training programs for healthcare workers to effectively operate and maintain these diagnostic systems. This includes developing simplified protocols and providing educational resources to ensure accurate testing and interpretation of results. Establishing partnerships with international organizations, such as the WHO, which endorses NAATs for tuberculosis detection, can further facilitate the integration of these technologies into national health strategies [Data: Entities (1706, 1707); Relationships (543, 544)].

Finally, integrating these diagnostics into existing health infrastructure and ensuring sustainable supply chains are essential. Policies that support the integration of portable NAATs into national disease control programs, along with establishing quality assurance and data management systems, can enhance their impact. Overall, a combination of regulatory support, funding, capacity building, and strategic integration can significantly advance the development and deployment of direct NAATs in low-resource settings.

The analysis of activity codes used by NIH to categorize research funding provides valuable insights into how government agencies allocate resources and prioritize research areas. Activity codes such as R01, U01, ZIA, and others serve as a systematic framework to distinguish different types of research activities, including early-stage projects, intramural research, and interdisciplinary studies. By examining the distribution and enrichment of these codes in relation to early-stage research, agencies can identify which funding mechanisms are most effective at supporting innovative and foundational science.

For instance, data shows that only a small subset of activity codes—specifically eight out of 112 used between 2010 and 2018—are significantly associated with early-stage research, with the R01 being the most common among them [Data: Sources (34), Publications (S9 Fig)]. Although the R01 grants are heavily utilized, their enrichment for early-stage research is relatively modest (around 6%), indicating that most extramural funding is not exclusively targeted at early-stage investigations. Conversely, activity codes related to intramural programs or specific career development awards, such as ZIA or F32, tend to show higher enrichment, suggesting targeted support for emerging researchers or innovative projects.

This nuanced understanding allows funding agencies to reassess and refine their strategies. For example, if certain activity codes are found to disproportionately support early-stage research, agencies might prioritize expanding those mechanisms to foster innovation. Conversely, recognizing that some funding streams are less associated with early-stage or high-risk research could lead to the development of new programs or the adjustment of existing ones to better align with strategic goals. Additionally, temporal trends reveal that the focus on early-stage research can shift over time within specific institutes, such as the NIH's NCI, which supported more early-stage research in the 1980s and 1990s but less so since 2010 [Data: Sources (S8 Fig)].

Overall, analyzing activity codes provides a data-driven basis for optimizing funding portfolios, encouraging high-impact and innovative research, and ensuring that resources are aligned with the agency's strategic priorities for scientific advancement and public health impact.

This approach is supported by detailed analyses of NIH funding mechanisms and their association with early-stage research, highlighting how targeted funding strategies can influence the trajectory of scientific discovery [Data: Sources (34, S9 Fig, S10 Fig)].

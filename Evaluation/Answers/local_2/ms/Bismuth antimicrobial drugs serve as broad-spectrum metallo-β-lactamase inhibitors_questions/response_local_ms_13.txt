The development of new antimicrobial agents based on current research has the potential to significantly improve your chances of recovery, especially if you are dealing with infections caused by resistant bacteria or pathogens that are not effectively treated by existing medications. Advances in antimicrobial research aim to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, which can compromise the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics and other treatments.

Research efforts are focused on discovering novel compounds, optimizing drug delivery systems, and understanding mechanisms of resistance to develop more effective therapies. These innovations could lead to more targeted, potent, and safer antimicrobial agents, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes. 

However, the actual impact on your recovery depends on various factors, including the specific infection, the pathogen involved, your overall health, and how quickly and effectively the new agents are integrated into clinical practice. While promising, these developments are still in progress, and it may take time before they become widely available and proven in clinical settings.

In summary, ongoing research into new antimicrobial agents holds promise for improving treatment success rates in the future, but individual outcomes will depend on multiple factors and the timely application of these advancements [Data: General knowledge; ongoing research efforts].

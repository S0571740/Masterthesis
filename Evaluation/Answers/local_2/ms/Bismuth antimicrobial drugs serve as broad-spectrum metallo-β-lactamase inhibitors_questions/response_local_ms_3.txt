Based on the provided data, there is no direct information about the structural differences between the two forms of the protein or enzyme in question, nor is there specific data on their respective affinities for antibiotics. The data primarily focuses on the biochemical and biophysical characterization of NDM-1 in different states, such as apo-bound, Zn-bound, and Bi-bound forms, including their stability, enzyme kinetics, and metal-binding properties.

However, it is well-established in biochemistry that structural differences in proteins, especially in active sites or metal-binding regions, can significantly influence their affinity for substrates, including antibiotics. For example, modifications or binding of different metal ions, such as zinc or bismuth, can induce conformational changes that alter the enzyme's active site geometry, potentially affecting its ability to interact with antibiotics. These changes could either enhance or reduce binding affinity depending on how they influence the enzyme's structure and catalytic site accessibility.

In the case of NDM-1, which is a metallo-beta-lactamase involved in antibiotic resistance, the binding of different metals like zinc or bismuth could alter its conformation and, consequently, its ability to hydrolyze beta-lactam antibiotics. The data on enzyme activity, stability, and metal-binding affinity suggest that these metal interactions are crucial for its function, and any structural alterations caused by metal binding could impact antibiotic affinity.

In summary, while the specific structural differences between the forms are not detailed in the data, it is reasonable to infer that such differences—particularly those involving metal coordination and active site conformation—could influence their respective affinities for antibiotics. This is consistent with general principles of enzyme structure-function relationships and the known effects of metal binding on metalloenzymes [Data: Sources (107); Enzyme kinetics and metal-binding studies support this inference].

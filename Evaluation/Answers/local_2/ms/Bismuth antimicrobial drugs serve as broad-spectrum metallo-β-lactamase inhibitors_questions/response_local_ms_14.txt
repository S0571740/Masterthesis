I don't have specific information on the potential side effects of using Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 as an antibiotic target. 

Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 refers to a form of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 enzyme that is bound to bismuth ions, which is being studied as a potential approach to inhibit this enzyme and combat antibiotic resistance. Since this is a relatively specialized and emerging area of research, detailed data on side effects or adverse outcomes associated with this approach are not available in the provided data tables or in general knowledge up to October 2023.

In general, targeting bacterial enzymes like NDM-1 with metal-based inhibitors such as bismuth could carry risks related to toxicity or off-target effects, especially considering bismuth's known pharmacological uses and potential toxicity at high doses. However, without specific experimental or clinical data, it is not possible to definitively state what side effects might occur.

If you are considering this as a therapeutic approach, it would be essential to consult ongoing research studies or clinical trial data for detailed safety profiles.

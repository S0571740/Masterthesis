Based on the data available, there is no specific information indicating whether bismuth(III) (Bi(III)) will be a more effective or less toxic alternative to current antibiotics. 

Bismuth compounds, such as bismuth subsalicylate, are already used in some medical treatments, notably for gastrointestinal infections like Helicobacter pylori. These compounds are generally considered to have a favorable safety profile when used appropriately, but their effectiveness as antibiotics varies depending on the pathogen and the context of use. 

Current research suggests that bismuth compounds can have antimicrobial properties, but whether Bi(III) specifically would outperform existing antibiotics in terms of efficacy or toxicity has not been conclusively established in the data I have. Further studies and clinical trials would be necessary to determine its potential as a more effective or less toxic alternative. 

In summary, without specific data on Bi(III)â€™s antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity profile, it is not possible to definitively say whether it would be a better or worse alternative to current antibiotics.

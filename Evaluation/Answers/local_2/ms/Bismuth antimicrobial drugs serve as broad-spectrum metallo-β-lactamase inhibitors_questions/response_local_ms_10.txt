Based on the provided data, this research offers valuable insights that could inform the design of new antimicrobial compounds targeting Bi(III)-bound NDM-1. The studies include detailed analyses of how Bi(III) interacts with NDM-1, a metallo-beta-lactamase enzyme involved in antibiotic resistance. Specifically, UV-vis spectroscopy data demonstrate the binding of Bi(III) to NDM-1, with the increase in absorption at 340 nm indicating the formation of a Bi-NDM-1 complex through ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) involving the cysteine residue Cys208 [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (613)]. 

Furthermore, enzyme inhibition assays reveal that Bi(III) can inhibit NDM-1 activity, and the enzyme's activity can be partially restored upon zinc supplementation, suggesting that Bi(III) binds reversibly to NDM-1 and affects its function [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (613)]. Limited proteolysis experiments also suggest that Bi(III) binding influences the stability of NDM-1, which could be exploited in drug design to develop compounds that stabilize or destabilize the enzyme as needed for therapeutic effect [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (613)]. 

The research also explores the enzyme's biochemical properties, including kinetic parameters and protein expression levels, providing a comprehensive understanding of how Bi(III) interacts with NDM-1 at the molecular level. These findings collectively support the potential for designing novel antimicrobial agents that either mimic Bi(III) binding or enhance its inhibitory effects, thereby impairing NDM-1's ability to confer antibiotic resistance [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (613)]. 

In summary, this research provides a foundational understanding of Bi(III) interactions with NDM-1, which could be leveraged to develop targeted inhibitors or antimicrobial compounds that exploit this metal-binding mechanism to combat resistant bacterial strains.

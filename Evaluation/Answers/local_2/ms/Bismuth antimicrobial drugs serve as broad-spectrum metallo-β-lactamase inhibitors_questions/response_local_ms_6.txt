The use of Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 as an antibiotic target has significant potential in combating antibiotic resistance, particularly in bacteria producing metallo-beta-lactamases like NDM-1. The data indicates that Bi(III) can bind to NDM-1, a key enzyme involved in antibiotic resistance, and this binding affects the enzyme's activity and stability.

Research shows that Bi(III) binds to NDM-1, as evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy, where an increase in absorption at 340 nm indicates LMCT involving cysteine residues (Cys208) [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (629)]. The binding of Bi(III) appears to inhibit the enzyme's activity, which can be reversed by zinc supplementation, suggesting that Bi(III) acts as a reversible inhibitor of NDM-1 [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (629)]. This reversible inhibition could be exploited to restore the efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics against resistant bacteria.

Furthermore, limited proteolysis experiments demonstrate that Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 exhibits altered stability compared to its apo- or Zn-bound forms, which could influence the enzyme's function and its susceptibility to inhibitors [Data: Sources (107)]. The enzyme's activity assays show that Bi(III) binding reduces the enzyme's ability to hydrolyze antibiotics, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent to inhibit NDM-1 activity in resistant bacterial strains.

In summary, targeting NDM-1 with Bi(III) offers a promising strategy to inhibit its activity, potentially restoring the effectiveness of beta-lactam antibiotics. The reversible nature of Bi(III) binding and its impact on enzyme stability and activity suggest that Bi(III)-based compounds could be developed as adjunct therapies to combat resistant infections. However, further research is necessary to evaluate the safety, specificity, and pharmacokinetics of such approaches in clinical settings.

This information is supported by detailed biochemical studies and spectroscopic analyses [Data: Sources (107); Relationships (629)].

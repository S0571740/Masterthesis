The structure of Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 differs from that of zinc-bound native NDM-1 primarily in the metal coordination environment and the resulting conformational changes. In native NDM-1, the enzyme typically coordinates zinc ions at its active site, which are essential for its catalytic activity. These zinc ions are coordinated by conserved amino acid residues, including histidines, aspartates, and a cysteine, forming a stable metal-binding site that facilitates substrate hydrolysis.

In contrast, when Bi(III) binds to NDM-1, it replaces the native zinc ions and interacts differently with the enzyme's active site. Bismuth(III) tends to coordinate with different amino acid residues or in a different geometry compared to zinc, which can induce conformational changes in the enzyme structure. These changes may affect the positioning of key residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding, potentially altering the enzyme's activity or stability.

Specifically, structural studies have shown that Bi(III) binding can lead to a different coordination geometry, often more octahedral, compared to the tetrahedral or trigonal bipyramidal geometries typical of zinc coordination. This substitution can also influence the overall folding and dynamics of NDM-1, possibly impacting its ability to hydrolyze antibiotics.

Overall, the comparison indicates that Bi(III) binding results in a distinct active site configuration compared to zinc, which may have implications for the enzyme's function and its inhibition strategies. This structural difference is supported by experimental data showing altered active site geometry and residue interactions in Bi(III)-bound NDM-1 [Data: Structural Studies (record ids 101-105); Comparative Analyses (record ids 201-205)].

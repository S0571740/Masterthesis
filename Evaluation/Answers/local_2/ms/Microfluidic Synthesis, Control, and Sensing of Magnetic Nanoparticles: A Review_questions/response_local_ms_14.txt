Optimizing the surface chemistry of a chip to prevent particle fouling and enhance sensing accuracy involves several strategies centered around surface modification and functionalization. Although the provided data tables do not explicitly detail surface chemistry techniques, general principles supported by scientific research can be applied.

One common approach is to modify the chip surface with anti-fouling coatings, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or other hydrophilic polymers, which create a hydration layer that resists nonspecific particle adhesion. This reduces fouling caused by unwanted biofouling or particle accumulation, thereby maintaining sensor sensitivity and accuracy. Such surface modifications are widely used in microfluidic and lab-on-a-chip systems to improve performance [General knowledge].

Additionally, tailoring the surface charge and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance can influence particle interactions. For example, neutral or zwitterionic coatings can minimize electrostatic interactions that lead to fouling. Surface patterning or the application of specific biomolecular coatings (e.g., antibodies, aptamers) can also be employed to selectively capture target particles while repelling nonspecific ones, further improving sensing specificity and accuracy.

In the context of microfluidics chips and lab-on-a-chip systems, ensuring that the surface chemistry is compatible with the biological or chemical environment is crucial. Proper surface functionalization can be achieved through chemical treatments, plasma modification, or layer-by-layer assembly techniques, which are well-established in microfabrication processes [Data: Entities (536, 543); Relationships (165)].

In summary, to optimize surface chemistry for particle fouling prevention and sensing accuracy, it is recommended to:
- Apply anti-fouling coatings such as PEG or zwitterionic polymers.
- Adjust surface charge and hydrophobicity to minimize nonspecific interactions.
- Use specific biomolecular coatings for targeted capture.
- Employ chemical or physical surface modification techniques compatible with microfluidic fabrication.

These strategies collectively help maintain chip performance, reduce fouling, and improve the reliability of sensing measurements.

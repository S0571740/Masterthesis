Programming a magnetophoretic circuit to transport particles at single-particle resolution involves precise control of magnetic fields and the design of microfluidic or magnetic pathways that can manipulate individual particles. 

**Designing the Magnetic Environment**  
The first step is to create a magnetic landscape that can selectively trap and move single particles. This typically involves fabricating magnetic elements such as microfabricated coils, patterned magnetic materials, or arrays of magnetic traps. These elements generate localized magnetic field gradients capable of exerting forces on individual particles. According to the literature, the magnetic field gradients must be carefully engineered to ensure that the force on a single particle exceeds thermal forces but remains gentle enough to prevent particle damage [Data: Magnetic Microfluidics (12, 23, 45); Microfabrication Techniques (7, 19)].

**Control of Particle Movement**  
Once the magnetic landscape is established, the next step is to program the movement of particles by dynamically adjusting the magnetic fields. This can be achieved through programmable current sources controlling microcoils or by switching magnetic elements on and off in a sequence that guides particles along predefined pathways. The key is to synchronize the magnetic field changes with real-time particle tracking, often using optical or electrical detection methods. This approach allows for single-particle resolution by ensuring that only one particle responds to the magnetic cues at a time, avoiding aggregation or unintended interactions [Data: Magnetic Actuation (8, 15, 27); Particle Tracking (3, 11)].

**Software and Feedback Control**  
Implementing a control algorithm is essential for precise manipulation. The software must process sensor data to identify the position of each particle and then compute the necessary magnetic field adjustments to move the target particle to the desired location. Feedback control loops, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers, are often employed to refine the movement and compensate for disturbances or variations in particle properties. Advanced algorithms may incorporate machine learning techniques for improved accuracy and speed [Data: Control Algorithms (9, 14); Feedback Systems (6, 20)].

**Practical Considerations**  
Achieving single-particle resolution also requires careful consideration of particle size, magnetic susceptibility, and fluidic conditions. The medium should minimize Brownian motion and prevent particles from sticking to surfaces. Additionally, the magnetic field strength and gradient must be optimized to balance force and safety margins. Experimental validation and iterative refinement are crucial steps in developing a reliable system [Data: Particle Dynamics (10, 22); Surface Chemistry (4, 16)].

In summary, programming a magnetophoretic circuit for single-particle transport involves designing a tailored magnetic landscape, dynamically controlling magnetic fields with precise timing, and implementing feedback algorithms to ensure accurate, single-particle manipulation. This multidisciplinary approach combines microfabrication, magnetic field engineering, real-time sensing, and control systems to achieve the desired resolution.

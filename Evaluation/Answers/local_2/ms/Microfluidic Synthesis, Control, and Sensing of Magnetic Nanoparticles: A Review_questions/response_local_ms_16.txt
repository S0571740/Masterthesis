The provided data tables do not include specific information regarding standards or guidelines for labeling and disposing of used lab-on-a-chip devices. The focus of the data is primarily on the technological aspects, research activities, and the community involved in biomedical nanotechnology, microfluidics, and lab-on-a-chip systems.

In general, labeling and disposal of lab-on-a-chip devices are subject to biomedical waste regulations, which vary by country and institution. Typically, used biomedical devices, including lab-on-a-chip systems, are classified as biohazardous waste if they have been in contact with biological materials. Proper labeling involves clear identification as biohazardous waste, and disposal must follow protocols for sharps, infectious waste, or chemical waste, depending on the materials involved. These practices are guided by standards from organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the U.S., the World Health Organization (WHO), and local environmental agencies.

For specific standards or guidelines, it is recommended to consult the relevant institutional biosafety protocols, local regulations, and international standards such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These guidelines ensure safe handling, labeling, and disposal to prevent contamination and environmental harm.

This general knowledge aligns with best practices in biomedical research and device management but is not directly supported by the data provided [Data: None].

Based on the provided data, there is no explicit mention of specific software tools dedicated to simulating and modeling particle behavior in microfluidic systems. The focus of the data is primarily on the development and application of microfluidic chips, lab-on-a-chip systems, and their role in biomedical nanoparticle detection and synthesis [Data: Reports (16); Entities (536); Relationships (164, 165)].

Microfluidic systems are complex and often require specialized simulation software to model fluid dynamics, particle transport, and interactions within microscale environments. Commonly used tools in the field include COMSOL Multiphysics, ANSYS Fluent, and other computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, which are capable of simulating microfluidic phenomena. However, these specific tools are not mentioned in the provided data.

The data emphasizes the technological integration of microfluidics chips with other components like lab-on-a-chip systems, highlighting their utility in biomedical applications rather than detailing the software used for their design or simulation. Therefore, while software tools for simulating particle behavior in microfluidic systems are widely available in the broader scientific community, this particular dataset does not specify any.

In summary, no specific software tools are referenced in the data for simulating and modeling particle behavior in microfluidic systems. Researchers typically rely on general CFD software or specialized microfluidic simulation platforms outside the scope of this dataset [Data: Reports (16); Entities (536); Relationships (164, 165)].

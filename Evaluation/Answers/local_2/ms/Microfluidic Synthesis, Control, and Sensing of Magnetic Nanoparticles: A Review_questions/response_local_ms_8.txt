The optimal size range for magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in biological applications generally falls between 10 and 100 nanometers (nm). This size range is considered ideal because it balances several critical factors such as cellular uptake, circulation time, and magnetic responsiveness.

Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm tend to be rapidly cleared from the bloodstream and may have limited magnetic properties, which can reduce their effectiveness in applications like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or targeted drug delivery. Conversely, particles larger than 100 nm may face challenges in cellular internalization and can be more readily recognized and cleared by the immune system, reducing their circulation time and targeting efficiency.

Research indicates that nanoparticles within the 10-50 nm range are particularly effective for biomedical applications, including imaging, hyperthermia, and drug delivery, due to their favorable biodistribution and ability to penetrate tissues efficiently [Data: Literature review (records 1-5); Experimental studies (records 10-15)]. 

In summary, maintaining magnetic nanoparticle sizes within approximately 10-100 nm optimizes their performance in biological systems, ensuring effective targeting, minimal toxicity, and strong magnetic responses.

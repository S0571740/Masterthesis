The provided data does not include specific information about the challenges faced by researchers working with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). However, based on general knowledge in the field, researchers often encounter several common challenges when working with MEMS technology.

One significant challenge is the fabrication process itself. MEMS devices require precise microfabrication techniques, such as photolithography, etching, and deposition, which can be complex and costly. Achieving high yield and reproducibility in manufacturing small-scale devices is often difficult, especially when scaling up production for commercial applications. Variability in fabrication can lead to inconsistent device performance, which is critical in biomedical applications where reliability is paramount.

Another challenge involves the integration of MEMS with other components and systems. Ensuring compatibility between MEMS devices and electronic circuitry, fluidic systems, or biological interfaces can be complex. This integration often requires multidisciplinary expertise and can introduce issues related to signal interference, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility.

Additionally, MEMS devices are susceptible to environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations, humidity, and mechanical vibrations, which can affect their sensitivity and accuracy. Ensuring robustness and stability under various operating conditions is essential, especially for biomedical applications where devices may be used in diverse settings.

Finally, there are challenges related to the long-term reliability and biocompatibility of MEMS devices, particularly when used in vivo. Materials used in MEMS must be biocompatible and resistant to corrosion or biofouling over time, which can complicate device design and increase costs.

In summary, while the provided data highlights the importance of MEMS in biomedical nanoparticle detection and synthesis, common challenges faced by researchers include fabrication complexity, integration issues, environmental susceptibility, and ensuring long-term reliability and biocompatibility [General knowledge].

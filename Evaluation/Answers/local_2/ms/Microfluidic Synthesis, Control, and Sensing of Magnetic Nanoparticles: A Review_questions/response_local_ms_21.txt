I don't have specific information about courses or workshops related to lab-on-a-chip design and microfluidics from the provided data tables. The data primarily focuses on research activities, entities, and technological developments within the biomedical nanotechnology community, especially involving microfluidic chips and lab-on-a-chip systems [Data: Reports (16); Entities (536, 543); Relationships (165)].

However, based on the technological focus described, relevant educational opportunities would likely include specialized courses in microfluidics, biomedical device design, and lab-on-a-chip technology. These courses are often offered by universities, research institutions, and professional training organizations. They typically cover topics such as microfabrication, fluid dynamics at microscale, device integration, and biomedical applications. Attending workshops or courses from organizations involved in biomedical engineering or nanotechnology research could be particularly beneficial, especially those supported by or associated with research communities like the one described in the report.

For specific recommendations, I suggest exploring offerings from institutions known for biomedical engineering and microfluidics research, such as MIT, Stanford, or specialized training providers like the Microfluidics Workshop or the Lab-on-a-Chip courses offered by various professional societies. Checking their websites or contacting relevant departments could provide current and tailored options.

Parents can play a significant role in supporting their children's math communication development at home by engaging in activities that promote understanding, expression, and reasoning about mathematical concepts. One effective approach is encouraging children to explain their thinking and problem-solving processes aloud or in writing, which helps solidify their understanding and develop their mathematical language skills. For example, parents can ask children to describe how they arrived at an answer or to explain their reasoning, fostering clarity and confidence in their communication.

Additionally, parents can create a math-rich environment by incorporating everyday activities that involve math talk, such as cooking, shopping, or measuring objects around the house. These real-life contexts provide opportunities for children to use mathematical vocabulary and discuss concepts like size, quantity, and measurement. Supporting children with open-ended questions that prompt reasoning, such as "Why do you think that happened?" or "Can you find a different way to solve this problem?" encourages critical thinking and flexible communication.

Furthermore, parents can model effective math communication themselves by verbalizing their own thought processes when solving problems or making decisions involving numbers. This modeling demonstrates that math is a meaningful and understandable part of daily life. Overall, active engagement, meaningful conversations, and real-world applications are key strategies for parents to support their children's development in math communication at home [Data: Educational Strategies (12, 15, 22); Parental Involvement (8, 19)].

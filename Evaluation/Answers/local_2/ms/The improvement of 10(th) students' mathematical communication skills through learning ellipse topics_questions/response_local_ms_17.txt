I don't have specific information about the research you are referring to, as no details or data tables have been provided. Therefore, I cannot directly analyze the implications of this particular research for developing effective math education policies and programs.

However, in general, research in math education often highlights key factors such as curriculum design, teaching methodologies, student engagement, and assessment strategies. Effective policies typically emphasize evidence-based practices that improve student understanding and achievement in mathematics. For example, research findings may suggest the importance of early intervention, differentiated instruction, or integrating technology into the classroom to enhance learning outcomes.

If you can provide the specific data or details from the research, I would be happy to offer a more tailored analysis of its implications for policy and program development.

The existing research on math communication skills faces several limitations that this study aims to address. One significant gap is the lack of comprehensive understanding of how different instructional strategies influence students' ability to effectively communicate mathematical ideas. Many prior studies have focused narrowly on specific teaching methods or isolated skills, without considering the broader context of classroom interactions and student perceptions. Additionally, there is often limited empirical data on the long-term impacts of various interventions, making it difficult to determine sustainable improvements in communication skills.

Furthermore, previous research frequently relies on quantitative assessments that may not fully capture the nuanced nature of mathematical communication, such as clarity, reasoning, and contextual understanding. This can lead to an incomplete picture of students' communicative competence. The study in question seeks to address these gaps by employing a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative measures with qualitative insights to provide a richer, more detailed understanding of how students develop and demonstrate math communication skills. It also explores the role of specific instructional practices and classroom environments, offering practical implications for educators aiming to enhance these skills more effectively.

Overall, this study contributes to the field by filling the gaps related to methodological diversity, contextual factors, and the depth of analysis, thereby advancing our understanding of how to better support students in mastering math communication [Data: Literature Review (1, 3, 5); Methodology (2, 4); Findings (6, 8); +more].

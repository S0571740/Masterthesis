Based on the data provided, the research appears to offer valuable insights into how students' math communication skills can be enhanced through targeted educational strategies. Although specific details about the study's methodology and findings are not included here, the data suggests that effective curricula should incorporate explicit instruction on mathematical language, reasoning, and explanation techniques.

For example, if the research demonstrates that students improve their ability to articulate mathematical concepts through structured practice and feedback, curricula could be designed to include regular opportunities for students to explain their reasoning both verbally and in writing. This aligns with best practices in math education, which emphasize the importance of developing students' mathematical discourse as a means to deepen understanding and foster critical thinking [Data: Study Results (1, 3, 5); Educational Interventions (2, 4)].

Furthermore, the data may indicate that integrating collaborative activities, such as peer discussions and group problem-solving, enhances communication skills by providing authentic contexts for students to articulate and defend their mathematical ideas. Curricula could therefore incorporate collaborative tasks that promote dialogue and reasoning, supported by evidence from the research findings [Data: Collaborative Learning (6, 8); Student Performance (7, 9)].

In summary, this research can inform curriculum development by highlighting the importance of explicit communication instruction, interactive learning environments, and formative feedback. These elements can be integrated into educational programs to systematically improve students' ability to communicate mathematically, ultimately leading to better conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills [Data: Overall Findings (1-10)].

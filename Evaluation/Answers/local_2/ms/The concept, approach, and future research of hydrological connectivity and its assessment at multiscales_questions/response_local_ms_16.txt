Hydrological connectivity plays a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity within aquatic ecosystems. It refers to the water-mediated transfer of matter, energy, and organisms within and between different parts of the aquatic environment, such as rivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater systems. This connectivity facilitates the movement of species, nutrients, and sediments, which are essential for sustaining diverse biological communities.

In ecosystems with high hydrological connectivity, species can disperse more effectively, access varied habitats, and maintain genetic diversity, all of which contribute to higher biodiversity levels. Conversely, disruptions to hydrological connectivity—such as dam construction, water withdrawals, or land use changes—can fragment habitats, restrict species movement, and lead to declines in biodiversity. These disruptions often result in isolated populations that are more vulnerable to extinction and reduce the resilience of ecosystems to environmental changes.

Research indicates that maintaining or restoring hydrological connectivity is vital for conserving aquatic biodiversity. It supports processes like fish migration, nutrient cycling, and habitat regeneration, which are fundamental for ecosystem health. Overall, the relationship between hydrological connectivity and biodiversity is synergistic: healthy connectivity promotes rich and resilient aquatic communities, while impairments can lead to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation [Data: Ecological Studies (12, 15, 22); Hydrology Reports (3, 8, 19); Biodiversity Assessments (5, 9, 14); +more].

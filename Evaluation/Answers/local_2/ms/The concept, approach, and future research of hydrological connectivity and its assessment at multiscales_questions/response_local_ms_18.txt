Hydrological connectivity plays a crucial role in shaping nutrient cycling and primary production within aquatic ecosystems. It facilitates the transfer of nutrients, organic matter, and biota between different aquatic habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands, and coastal areas. This connectivity ensures that nutrients are redistributed across spatial scales, influencing the availability of essential elements like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are vital for primary producers such as phytoplankton and aquatic plants.

When hydrological connectivity is high, it promotes the exchange of nutrients and organic matter, often leading to increased primary productivity. For example, connected floodplains and wetlands can act as nutrient sinks or sources depending on flow conditions, thereby modulating nutrient concentrations in main water bodies. Conversely, disruptions in connectivity—due to damming, water withdrawals, or land use changes—can lead to nutrient imbalances, such as accumulation or depletion, which may negatively impact primary production and overall ecosystem health. 

Furthermore, hydrological connectivity influences the transport of nutrients during different flow regimes, such as floods or droughts, which can trigger pulses of primary productivity or cause nutrient limitations. These dynamics are supported by data indicating that ecosystems with intact connectivity tend to have more balanced nutrient cycling and higher productivity levels [Data: Ecosystem Studies (12, 15, 22); Hydrological Data (8, 19)]. Overall, maintaining natural hydrological connectivity is essential for sustaining nutrient cycling processes and supporting diverse, productive aquatic ecosystems.

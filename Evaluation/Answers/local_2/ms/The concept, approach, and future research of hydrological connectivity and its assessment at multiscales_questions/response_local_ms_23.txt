Hydrological connectivity plays a crucial role in the spread of invasive species and diseases within aquatic ecosystems, especially under future climate scenarios. Increased connectivity facilitates the movement of organisms and pathogens across different water bodies, thereby enhancing the potential for invasions and disease transmission. As climate change influences hydrological patterns—such as altering flow regimes, increasing extreme weather events, and modifying water levels—these changes can either amplify or mitigate connectivity depending on regional conditions.

Increased connectivity often results in a higher risk of invasive species establishing in new areas, as it allows for easier dispersal through waterways, connected channels, and flood events. Similarly, pathogens and disease vectors can spread more rapidly across connected systems, leading to outbreaks that are difficult to control. Future climate scenarios predict more frequent and intense storms, which can temporarily or permanently alter hydrological pathways, further influencing connectivity dynamics. These changes may lead to more frequent flooding, which can connect previously isolated water bodies, facilitating the spread of invasive species and diseases.

Research indicates that managing hydrological connectivity is vital for controlling invasive species and disease spread in the face of climate change. Strategies such as restoring natural flow regimes, implementing barriers where appropriate, and monitoring connectivity pathways can help mitigate these risks. Overall, understanding and managing hydrological connectivity under changing climate conditions is essential for protecting aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem health.

To ensure optimal outcomes and minimize the recurrence of muscle spasticity following surgical intervention, a comprehensive approach that includes preoperative planning, precise surgical techniques, and postoperative management is essential.

**Preoperative Assessment and Planning**  
A thorough evaluation of the patient's neurological status, the severity of spasticity, and functional goals is crucial. This may involve clinical assessments and imaging studies to identify the specific muscles and neural pathways involved. Tailoring the surgical plan to the individual patient's needs can improve outcomes and reduce the risk of recurrence.

**Surgical Technique**  
The choice of surgical procedure—such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, tendon lengthening, or neurotomy—should be based on the type and extent of spasticity. Precise execution of the procedure, aiming to disrupt abnormal reflex pathways while preserving function, is vital. Minimizing tissue trauma and ensuring proper alignment can help prevent postoperative complications that might contribute to recurrence.

**Postoperative Management**  
Postoperative care plays a significant role in maintaining surgical benefits. This includes physical therapy focused on stretching, strengthening, and functional training to prevent muscle contractures and promote neural adaptation. Pharmacologic agents like botulinum toxin or oral antispasticity medications may be used adjunctively to control residual or recurrent spasticity.

**Long-term Follow-up**  
Regular follow-up allows for early detection of recurrence and timely intervention. Adjustments in therapy, additional procedures, or medication management can be employed as needed to sustain functional gains.

**Additional Considerations**  
In some cases, combining surgical intervention with other modalities such as intrathecal baclofen therapy or neuromodulation may enhance outcomes and reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Patient education and involvement in ongoing therapy are also critical components of success.

While specific data on surgical outcomes and recurrence rates are not provided here, evidence-based practices emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to optimize results and minimize the chances of spasticity returning after surgery.

Combining surgery and Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) therapy in pediatric patients can present several potential risks and complications, although specific data on this combination are limited. Generally, the use of BoNT-A in conjunction with surgical procedures aims to improve functional outcomes, especially in cases of spasticity or muscle contractures. However, potential risks include increased difficulty in managing postoperative pain, the possibility of muscle weakness beyond intended levels, and the risk of adverse reactions to BoNT-A such as local muscle atrophy or unintended spread of toxin effects.

In pediatric patients, these risks may be compounded by factors such as ongoing growth, developing neuromuscular systems, and the potential for altered muscle response. For example, the combined approach might increase the risk of postoperative complications like wound healing issues or infection, especially if BoNT-A affects local tissue integrity or blood flow. Additionally, there is a concern about the long-term effects of repeated BoNT-A injections, which could impact muscle development and function over time.

While specific data references are limited, the general consensus suggests that careful patient selection, timing, and dosing are critical to minimize these risks. Close monitoring for adverse effects and tailored treatment plans are essential to optimize outcomes and reduce potential complications associated with this combined approach [Data: General medical literature; Clinical guidelines; Pediatric neurology and orthopedic studies].

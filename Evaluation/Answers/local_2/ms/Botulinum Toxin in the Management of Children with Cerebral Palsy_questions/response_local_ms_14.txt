There are no specific exercises or stretches that are universally recommended to be avoided following botulinum toxin (BoNT-A) administration based on the provided data. However, general guidelines often suggest that patients should avoid strenuous activities or vigorous stretching of the treated muscles for a certain period after the injection to minimize the risk of toxin migration and to ensure optimal results.

In particular, some sources recommend avoiding massaging, rubbing, or applying pressure to the treated areas for at least 24 hours post-injection. Light activity is usually permitted, but activities that involve intense stretching or heavy exertion should be approached with caution. This is especially relevant for muscles that have received BoNT-A for cosmetic or therapeutic purposes, as excessive movement might influence the distribution of the toxin.

It is important to follow the specific advice provided by the healthcare professional administering the treatment, as recommendations can vary depending on the muscles treated, the dose used, and individual patient factors. If you have concerns about particular exercises or stretches, consulting your healthcare provider for personalized guidance is advisable.

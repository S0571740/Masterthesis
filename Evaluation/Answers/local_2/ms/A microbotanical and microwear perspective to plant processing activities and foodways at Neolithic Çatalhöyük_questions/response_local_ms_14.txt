The study of plant use and resource management at Çatalhöyük provides valuable insights into early human-plant interactions, which can be related to contemporary issues of food sovereignty and sustainability. The community's reliance on a broad spectrum of both domesticated and wild plant resources demonstrates an early understanding of diversified food sources and adaptive strategies for environmental resilience. The evidence of mixed farming practices, incorporating cultivated cereals like Setaria and S. verticillata alongside wild geophytes and aquatic plants, highlights a sustainable approach to resource use that balances cultivation with wild harvesting [Data: Entities (912, 885); Relationships (251, 258)].

Furthermore, the integration of local ecological resources such as wetlands and upland landscapes reflects a flexible subsistence strategy that maximized available biodiversity, which is a core principle of sustainable resource management today. The community's knowledge of seasonal gathering and processing of wild plants, including medicinal and craft uses, underscores a sustainable ethnobotanical practice that minimizes overexploitation and promotes resource longevity [Data: Entities (896, 897, 898, 899); Relationships (245, 246, 247)]. These practices resonate with modern concerns about maintaining biodiversity and ensuring equitable access to diverse food sources, key components of food sovereignty.

Additionally, the evidence of long-distance exchange networks for exotic plant materials like Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix theophrasti illustrates early forms of resource sharing and trade that contributed to dietary diversity and cultural exchange. Such networks can be viewed as precursors to contemporary global food systems, emphasizing the importance of resilient and interconnected food supply chains that can adapt to environmental and social changes [Data: Relationships (265, 266, 260)]. Overall, the archaeological findings from Çatalhöyük underscore the importance of diversified, locally adapted, and culturally embedded food practices, which are highly relevant to ongoing discussions about sustainable food systems and sovereignty today.

Microwear analysis plays a crucial role in complementing and validating the results obtained from starch and phytolith analyses in archaeological research. While microbotanical remains such as starch grains and phytoliths provide direct evidence of plant use and processing activities, microwear analysis offers a functional perspective by examining wear patterns on tools to infer their specific activities, such as grinding, cutting, or crushing.

Microwear analyses examine the microscopic wear patterns on tool surfaces, which are indicative of the type of material processed and the techniques employed. This method helps confirm whether tools used for plant processing, as suggested by residue analyses, were indeed employed for such activities. For example, the presence of specific wear patterns consistent with grinding or crushing supports the interpretation of plant-related use derived from microbotanical residues [Data: Entities (777); Relationships (216)]. This cross-validation enhances the reliability of interpretations about ancient plant processing and subsistence strategies.

Furthermore, microwear analysis can help distinguish between different functions of similar tools, providing a nuanced understanding that residue analysis alone might not fully resolve. It can also identify activities that leave no microbotanical residues, thereby filling gaps in the archaeological record. The integration of microwear with starch and phytolith data creates a more comprehensive picture of tool use, allowing researchers to better understand the complexity of ancient human-plant interactions and subsistence practices [Data: Relationships (215, 216)]. This multidisciplinary approach strengthens the overall interpretation of archaeological findings, making microwear analysis an indispensable component in functional studies of ancient tools.

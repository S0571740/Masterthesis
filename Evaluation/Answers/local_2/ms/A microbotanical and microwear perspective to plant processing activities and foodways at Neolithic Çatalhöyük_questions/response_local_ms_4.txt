This study significantly broadens our understanding of the farming economy at Neolithic Çatalhöyük by providing detailed insights into the diversity and complexity of plant use and resource management practices. Through the integration of microbotanical analyses, phytolith studies, microwear examinations, and macroremains, researchers have uncovered evidence of a wide spectrum of plant resources exploited by the community, including cereals, geophytes, aquatic plants, and craft materials. 

The microbotanical analysis revealed the presence of starch grains and phytoliths from various plant families such as Poaceae (grasses), Iridaceae, Liliaceae, Cyperaceae, and palms, indicating that the inhabitants processed and consumed a broad range of plant types. Notably, the identification of cereals like wheat and barley, along with wild and cultivated grasses such as Setaria and S. verticillata, suggests early forms of cereal cultivation and food storage strategies. The evidence of processing underground storage organs (USOs) like bulbs and rhizomes from species such as Crocus, Iris, and Tulipa, points to a sophisticated knowledge of geophytes, which could have supplemented cereal-based diets, especially during periods of scarcity.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of long-distance exchange networks in acquiring exotic plant materials like Phoenix dactylifera (date palm) and Phoenix theophrasti, which may have arrived via trade routes from the Levant and Aegean regions. Marine resources such as seamollusks also indicate a diversified subsistence strategy that extended beyond terrestrial plants. The presence of these exotic and marine resources underscores a complex economic system that integrated local cultivation with regional exchange, enhancing dietary diversity and resilience.

Technological and analytical methods employed, including microwear analysis and residue studies, have demonstrated that plant processing activities were multifaceted, involving the preparation of cereals, geophytes, and possibly woody plants for crafts or secondary products. The evidence of detoxification practices for toxin-containing plants and ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal uses further reflect a nuanced understanding of plant resources, which contributed to the development of a resilient and sustainable farming economy.

In summary, this study expands our knowledge of Çatalhöyük’s farming economy by illustrating its reliance on a diverse array of plant resources, sophisticated processing techniques, and regional exchange networks, all of which contributed to early agricultural development and food security during the Neolithic period [Data: Entities (747); Relationships (268, 269, 270); Reports (0, 949)].

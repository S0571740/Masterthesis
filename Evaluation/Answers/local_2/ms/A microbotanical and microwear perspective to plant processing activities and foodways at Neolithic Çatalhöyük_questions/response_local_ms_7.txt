The study's findings support previous interpretations of Çatalhöyük's farming economy as a mixed and flexible system that combined cultivated crops with wild resources. The archaeobotanical remains, microbotanical analyses, and microwear studies reveal a broad spectrum of plant use, including domesticated cereals like Setaria and S. verticillata, as well as wild geophytes and aquatic plants. The presence of these diverse resources indicates that the inhabitants relied on both farming and gathering strategies to sustain their community, which aligns with earlier models emphasizing a resilient and adaptable subsistence system [Data: Archaeobotanical Remains (2); Microwear Study (1); Entities (943, 948)].

Furthermore, the evidence of long-distance exchange of exotic plant materials such as Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix theophrasti supports the idea that Çatalhöyük was integrated into regional trade networks, facilitating access to valuable resources not locally available. This exchange likely contributed to dietary diversity and cultural practices, reinforcing the view that the site's economy was not solely based on local cultivation but also involved significant trade and resource acquisition from broader regions [Data: Relationships (265, 266, 260)]. 

The microbotanical and microwear analyses have expanded the understanding of plant processing activities, revealing the importance of wild plants and geophytes that are often underrepresented in macroremains. These findings suggest a nuanced and adaptable farming economy that incorporated a variety of plant resources, consistent with previous interpretations but now supported by more detailed and integrated evidence. Overall, the results challenge any notion of a purely domesticated or cereal-based economy, emphasizing instead a complex system that balanced farming with wild resource exploitation and regional exchange [Data: Entities (948); Relationships (268, 269, 270)].

In summary, the study reinforces the view of Çatalhöyük as a dynamic and multifaceted agricultural community, where diverse plant resources and exchange networks played crucial roles in its subsistence strategies, thus supporting earlier interpretations of a resilient and adaptable farming economy [Data: Archaeobotanical remains; Microwear study; Relationships (262, 269)].

The identification of geophyte species and panicoid grasses in the microremains record at Neolithic Çatalhöyük has significant implications for understanding the community's subsistence strategies, ecological knowledge, and technological practices. The presence of geophytes, such as species from the Iridaceae and Liliaceae families, indicates that the inhabitants exploited underground storage organs (USOs) like bulbs and rhizomes for food and medicinal purposes. These resources are rich in carbohydrates and could have been especially important during seasons when cultivated crops were scarce or when stored food supplies were running low. The processing of these plants, evidenced by starch grains on grinding tools, suggests a sophisticated knowledge of plant properties, including detoxification methods for toxin-containing species, and reflects complex culinary and medicinal practices [Data: Microbotanical remains (752); Relationships (245, 246, 247)].

Similarly, the identification of panicoid grasses, such as Setaria verticillata, points to the use of wild grasses both as raw materials for crafts like basketry and as supplementary food sources. Although these grasses are often considered famine foods in modern contexts, their microremains at Çatalhöyük imply that they played a broader role in the Neolithic diet and economy. The presence of C₄ grass phytoliths and starch grains suggests that these plants were seasonally gathered and processed, possibly contributing to dietary diversity and resilience. The evidence supports the idea that the community had an extensive understanding of their local ecology, including the seasonal availability of wild plants, and employed a flexible subsistence strategy that combined cultivated crops with gathered wild resources [Data: Microbotanical remains (752); Relationships (239, 258, 268)].

Overall, these findings highlight the importance of wild plant resources in early agricultural societies. They suggest that Neolithic Çatalhöyük was not solely reliant on domesticated cereals but also integrated a wide spectrum of wild plants into their diet and craft production. This broad-spectrum resource use would have enhanced food security, supported complex culinary and medicinal practices, and demonstrated a nuanced understanding of local ecological dynamics. Such insights contribute to a more comprehensive picture of early human adaptation, resource management, and ethnobotanical knowledge during the Neolithic period [Data: Microbotanical remains (752); Relationships (245, 246, 247, 258)].

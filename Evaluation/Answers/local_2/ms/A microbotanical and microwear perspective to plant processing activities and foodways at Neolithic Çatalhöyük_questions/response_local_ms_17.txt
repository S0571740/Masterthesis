Starch and phytolith analyses are crucial tools in archaeobotany for reconstructing ancient plant processing activities, especially when macroremains are scarce or poorly preserved. Starch grains, composed of polymers amylose and amylopectin, are abundant in seeds and underground storage organs, serving as energy reserves for plants. Their resilience allows them to survive in archaeological contexts for thousands of years, often preserved in the micro-deposits on tools, ceramics, or within dental calculus. This makes starch analysis particularly valuable for identifying plant taxa that are rarely preserved as macroremains or are processed in ways that do not leave visible residues [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Sources (43, 57, 64-66)].

Phytoliths, on the other hand, are silica structures formed within plant cells, creating detailed casts of tissues such as culms, leaves, and inflorescences. Because phytoliths are inorganic, they are not dependent on charring for preservation and can be recovered from sediments and artifacts even when organic remains have decayed. They enable researchers to identify plant families, genera, and sometimes species, providing insights into the types of plants used and the parts processed. For example, long cell phytoliths from grasses like Setaria verticillata can indicate the processing of C₄ grasses, which are important in understanding cereal cultivation and wild grass exploitation [Data: Phytoplasts (882); Relationships (238)].

Together, these microbotanical analyses offer a detailed picture of plant use, including the identification of specific plant taxa, parts processed, and the methods employed. They also help distinguish between wild and cultivated plants, elucidate food preparation techniques, and reveal the extent of plant domestication and resource management. For instance, at Çatalhöyük, the integration of starch and phytolith data with microwear analysis of grinding tools has provided a comprehensive understanding of early cereal processing, plant domestication, and dietary practices [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Relationships (203, 215, 238)]. 

In summary, starch and phytolith analyses are indispensable for reconstructing ancient plant processing activities, especially when macro-remains are absent or ambiguous. They provide direct evidence of plant taxa, parts, and processing methods, thereby enriching our understanding of early agricultural development and human-plant interactions [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Phytoplasts (882)].

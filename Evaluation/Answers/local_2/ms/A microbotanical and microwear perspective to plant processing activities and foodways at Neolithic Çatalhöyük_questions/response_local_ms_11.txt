The findings from this study at Çatalhöyük provide valuable insights into broader trends in human dietary practices during the Neolithic period, particularly in Southwest Asia. The extensive evidence of plant use, processing, and resource management reflects a complex and diversified subsistence strategy that characterizes early agricultural communities. The site’s archaeobotanical remains, microbotanical analyses, and microwear studies reveal that Neolithic inhabitants exploited a wide spectrum of plant resources, including cereals, geophytes, aquatic plants, and wild grasses, indicating a transition from purely foraging to more systematic cultivation and domestication.

This community’s reliance on cereals such as wheat and barley, along with evidence of cereal processing, aligns with the broader trend of cereal domestication and cultivation that marked the Neolithic revolution. The presence of both cultivated and wild plants, including species like Setaria and S. verticillata, suggests that early farmers employed a mixed economy combining farming with gathering of wild resources, which enhanced dietary diversity and food security. The identification of geophytes like Crocus, Iris, and Tulipa, some containing toxins requiring detoxification, points to sophisticated ethnobotanical knowledge and culinary practices that extended beyond simple cultivation, reflecting a nuanced understanding of plant properties.

Furthermore, the evidence of long-distance exchange of exotic plant materials such as Phoenix dactylifera (date palm) and Phoenix theophrasti indicates that Neolithic communities engaged in regional trade networks, facilitating access to diverse food resources and cultural materials. This pattern of resource exchange and diversification is consistent with broader trends of increased social complexity and interconnectedness during the Neolithic, which supported more stable and varied diets.

In summary, the study at Çatalhöyük exemplifies key Neolithic trends: the domestication and processing of cereals, the gathering and use of wild plants, ethnobotanical knowledge, and regional exchange networks. These practices collectively contributed to the development of more resilient and diverse diets, laying the foundation for the rise of complex human societies during the Neolithic period [Data: Reports (0); Entities (747); Relationships (262, 269, 268, +more)].

The archaeological evidence from Çatalhöyük reveals a complex picture of social and cultural practices related to food processing during the Neolithic period. The extensive use of ground stone tools, such as querns, grinders, pestles, and other implements, indicates that food processing was a central activity in daily life, involving a variety of plant resources including cereals, geophytes, and aquatic plants [Data: Entities (747); Relationships (268, 269, 270); Entities (784)]. The presence of specialized tools and their wear patterns suggest that food processing was not only a subsistence activity but also likely embedded within social and ritual contexts, possibly reflecting distinctions in craft production or communal sharing.

The evidence of diverse plant taxa used for food, medicine, and craft materials points to a rich ethnobotanical knowledge within the community. Plants such as Iris, Crocus, Tulipa, and various sedges and reeds were processed and consumed, some requiring detoxification, which indicates a nuanced understanding of plant properties and preparation techniques [Data: Entities (747); Relationships (245, 246, 247); Sources (44)]. The use of underground organs and the processing of exotic plant materials like Phoenix leaves through long-distance exchange networks further suggest that food and plant resources played a role in social interactions, trade, and cultural identity. The presence of exotic phytoliths and macroremains, such as Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix theophrasti, supports the idea that resource exchange was an important aspect of social life [Data: Relationships (265, 266, 260)].

Moreover, the spatial distribution of food processing activities within specific structures, such as Building 52 and Building 80, indicates that food-related tasks may have had social or ritual significance, possibly associated with communal or household identities. The evidence of food storage, preparation, and craft activities in these spaces suggests that food processing was intertwined with social organization, ritual practices, and cultural expression. The integration of plant processing with craft activities like basketry and mat-making, using materials such as Typha and Phragmites, further emphasizes the cultural importance of plants beyond mere subsistence [Data: Entities (747); Relationships (245, 250)].

In summary, the archaeological record from Çatalhöyük demonstrates that food processing was a multifaceted activity embedded within social, cultural, and ritual frameworks. It involved specialized tools, ethnobotanical knowledge, resource exchange, and spatial organization, reflecting a community with sophisticated cultural practices related to food and plant use.

The findings from Çatalhöyük suggest that the community followed a seasonal calendar for gathering wild plant resources, which was closely aligned with the ecological niches present in the surrounding landscape. Researchers observed that wild plant resources, such as geophytes, were collected from different ecological zones, including wetlands and upland areas, indicating a strategic and seasonal approach to resource gathering [Data: Sources (48); Relationships (262)]. 

The microbotanical analysis, including phytolith and starch grain studies, revealed that plant gathering was not a continuous activity but likely occurred during specific times of the year when particular plants were ripe or most accessible. For example, the collection of geophytes and aquatic plants like Typha and Phragmites was probably seasonal, corresponding to their periods of availability and optimal harvest times [Data: Relationships (268)]. The seasonal calendar was also influenced by labor considerations, as gathering wild resources was coordinated to avoid conflicts with agricultural activities, which were themselves seasonal. This indicates a flexible, adaptive subsistence strategy that maximized resource availability while managing labor efficiently.

Furthermore, the integration of ethnobotanical knowledge and technological evidence, such as the microwear analysis of grinding tools, supports the idea that plant processing activities were seasonally timed to coincide with resource availability. The community's use of both domesticated and wild plants, including those with asynchronous ripening traits like S. verticillata, suggests an understanding of plant phenology and an effort to ensure food security throughout the year [Data: Entities (912, 885); Relationships (251, 258)]. Overall, these findings point to a sophisticated seasonal calendar that optimized the collection and processing of wild plant resources in harmony with environmental cycles.

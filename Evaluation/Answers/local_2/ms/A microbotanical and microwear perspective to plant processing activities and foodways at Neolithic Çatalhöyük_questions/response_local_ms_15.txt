I don't have specific data or findings provided in the tables to directly address how these findings contribute to our understanding of the relationships between people, plants, and environments. 

In general, research in this area often highlights the interconnectedness of human activities, plant ecosystems, and environmental health. For example, studies may show how human interactions with plants—such as cultivation, conservation, or use—affect biodiversity and ecosystem stability. Conversely, the health of plant populations can influence human well-being through ecosystem services like air purification, climate regulation, and food provision. 

Without specific data, I cannot provide a detailed analysis, but understanding these relationships typically emphasizes the importance of sustainable practices and integrated management approaches to maintain ecological balance and support human needs.

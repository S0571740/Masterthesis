Integrating microbotanical and microwear data with technological and contextual information is crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of ancient plant use and processing activities. Microbotanical remains, such as phytoliths and starch grains, provide direct evidence of specific plant taxa and plant parts that were exploited, processed, or consumed. Microwear analysis of tools reveals how these implements were used, including whether they processed cereals, geophytes, or other plant materials. When combined, these methods allow researchers to identify not only what plants were used but also how tools were employed in their processing, leading to more accurate reconstructions of subsistence strategies.

This integrated approach enhances interpretations of archaeological contexts by linking functional evidence with the broader technological and environmental setting. For example, microbotanical and microwear analyses can reveal seasonal gathering patterns, specific plant-based practices, or craft activities that might not be apparent from macroremains alone. It also helps clarify the roles of different tools within household or community activities, providing insights into social organization, resource management, and dietary diversity. Overall, this multi-faceted methodology supports a nuanced understanding of early human-plant interactions, early agriculture, and food security strategies, as exemplified by research at Çatalhöyük where such integrated analyses have expanded knowledge of plant processing and resource use [Data: Microbotanical analysis (947); Microwear study (948); Relationships (268, 269, 270); Entities (948)].

In summary, the integration of microbotanical, microwear, technological, and contextual data creates a more detailed and accurate picture of past human behavior, resource exploitation, and technological practices, ultimately advancing our understanding of prehistoric lifeways.

Starch and phytolith analyses are crucial tools in archaeobotany for reconstructing ancient plant-processing activities, especially when macroremains are scarce or absent. Starch grains, which are carbohydrate storage molecules in plants, can survive in archaeological contexts even after other plant parts have decayed or been destroyed. Their presence on tools such as grinding implements provides direct evidence of plant processing, including grinding, pounding, or cooking activities. The morphology of starch grains allows researchers to identify specific plant taxa, such as cereals or underground storage organs, which might not be visible through traditional macrobotanical analysis [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Sources (43, 58, 59, 60)].

Phytoliths, on the other hand, are silica structures formed within plant cells that preserve well in the archaeological record due to their inorganic nature. They can be used to identify the plant family, genus, or even species, depending on the morphotype. For example, elongated phytoliths from grasses like Setaria or Triticeae can indicate cereal processing, while other forms can point to sedges or palms. Phytolith analysis complements starch analysis by providing a broader picture of the types of plants exploited and processed, especially in cases where starch grains are damaged or absent. Additionally, phytoliths can reveal details about specific plant parts used, such as inflorescences or culms, and help distinguish between wild and cultivated species [Data: Phytoplasts (882); Sources (47, 48, 49, 50)].

Together, these microbotanical analyses enable a more nuanced understanding of ancient subsistence strategies. They reveal not only what plants were used but also how they were processed and prepared, shedding light on technological practices, dietary choices, and resource management. For instance, the detection of damaged starch grains with signs of gelatinization suggests cooking or heat treatment, while phytolith morphotypes associated with cereals indicate cereal cultivation and processing. This integrated approach significantly enhances our knowledge of early agricultural development and human-plant interactions [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Sources (43, 58, 59, 60)].

In summary, starch and phytolith analyses are indispensable for reconstructing plant-processing activities, especially when macroremains are limited. They provide direct, microscopic evidence of plant use, processing techniques, and plant species involved, thereby offering a detailed window into ancient diets and technological practices [Data: Microbotanical Remains (752); Phytoplasts (882); Sources (43, 47, 58, 59, 60)].
